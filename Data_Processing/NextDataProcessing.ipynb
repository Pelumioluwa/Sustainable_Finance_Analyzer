However, as this publication is a \\nreference tool, we have not removed any disclosures based on materiality. Con sequently, some of the \\ndisclosures in this publication would likely be immaterial if the bank were  a ‘real life’ company.  \\nIFRS 9 allows a variety of approaches in measuring expected credit losses (ECL)  and industry thinking \\ncontinues to evolve at the date of this publication . Banks will need to take account of their individual \\ncircumstances in determining the approach taken to measuring ECL  and the appropriate disclosures . The \\napproaches illustrated in this publication are one possible way the requirement s of IFRS 9 ECL may be \\nmet but are not intended to provide any view on the type of approach that should be applied . \\nUsing this publication  \\nThe source for each disclosure requirement is given in the reference column. There is also commentary that (i) \\nexplains  some of the most challenging areas, or (ii) lists disclosures that have not been included because they \\nare not relevant to the fictional bank’s circumstances.  \\nThe example disclosures may not be the only acceptable form of presenting financial statement di sclosures. \\nAlternative presentations may be acceptable if they comply with the specific disclosure requirements prescribed \\nby IFRS. Readers may find our IFRS disclosure checklist useful to identify other disclosures that may be \\nrelevant under the circumsta nces but are not illustrated in this publication (such as those highlighted in \\nobservations boxes throughout this publication). Conversely,  disclosures prese nted in this publication \\nshould  not be included where they are not relevant or not material in  spec ific circumstances.  \\nPreparers of financial reporting should also consider local legal and regulatory requirements which may \\nstipulate additional disclosures that are not illustrated in this publication. Specific ally, this publication \\ndoes  not cover the dis closure  recommendations proposed by the Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF) in  its \\n‘Impact of Expected Credit Loss Approaches on Bank Risk Disclosures ’ report.  \\nFinally, we note that, when banks provide some of the disclosures required by IFRS in section s of their Annual \\nReports other than the financial statements, these too need to be updated for changes introduced by IFRS 9.   \\nIntroduction  ', ' \\nIFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures   PwC \\uf0b7 2 Consolidated statement of profit or loss  \\nIAS1(10)(b),(10A)   \\nYear ended 31 December  \\nIAS1(51)(c),(e) \\nIAS1(113)    2018  \\nCU’000  2017  \\nCU’000  \\nIFRS7(20)(b),  Interest income   \\n10,010  8,059  \\nIAS1(82)(a)  \\nIFRS7(20)(b)  Interest expense   \\n(7,852)  (6,269)  \\n \\nNet interest income   \\n2,158  1,790  \\nIFRS7(20)(c)  Fee and commission income   \\n1,391  1,326  \\nIFRS7(20)(c)  Fee and commission expense   \\n(378)  (392) \\n \\nNet fee and commission income   \\n1,013  934 \\n \\nNet trading income   \\n421 323 \\n \\nNet investment income   \\n188 90 \\nIAS1(82)(ba)  Credit impairment losses    (530)  (300)  \\nIAS1(82)(aa)  Net gains/(losses) on derecognition of financial assets measured at \\namortised cos t    (12) N/A \\n \\nOther operating income   \\n12 30 \\n \\nNet other operating income   \\n79 143 \\n Personnel expenses   \\n(983)  (1,057)  \\n General and administrative expenses   \\n(315)  (351)  \\n Depreciation and amortisation expense   \\n(451)  (447)  \\n Other operating expenses   \\n(278)  (192)  \\n \\nOperating profit   \\n1,223  820 \\nIAS1(82)(c)  Share of profit of associates and joint ventures accounted for using the \\nequity method   \\n12 15 \\n Profit before income tax   \\n1,235  835 \\nIAS1(82)(d), \\nIAS12(77)  Income tax expense   \\n(122)  (20) \\nIAS1(81A)(a)  Profi t for the year   \\n1,113  815 \\nIAS1(81B)(a)  Profit attributable to:     \\n \\nEquity holders of the parent entity   \\n1,106  831 \\n \\nNon-controlling interests   \\n7 (16) \\nIAS33(66)  Earnings per share for the profit attributable to the equity holders \\nof the parent entity dur ing the year  (expressed in CU per  share):     \\n \\n\\xad Basic   \\n0.90 0.82 \\n \\n\\xad Diluted   \\n0.78 0.70 \\n \\nThe above consolidated statement of profit or loss should be read in co njunction with the \\naccompanying  notes.  \\n New presentation requirements in applying IFRS  9. \\n ', ' \\nIFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures   PwC \\uf0b7 3 PwC ob servation – Disclosure of items of income, expense, gains or losses and reclassification  \\nParagraph 20 of IFRS 7 requires disclosure, either in the statement of comprehensive income or in the \\nnotes, of the following items of income, expense, gains or losses : \\n\\uf0b7 Net gain or net losses on:  \\n- Financial assets or financial liabilities measured at FVPL, showing separately those designated \\nupon initial recognition and those that are mandatorily measured at FVPL.

Significant  accounting policies  \\n1.1 Changes in accounting policies  \\nIFRS9  (7.2.15)  The Group has adopte d IFRS 9 as issued by the IASB in July 2014 with a date of transition of  \\n1 January 2018, which resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts \\npreviously recognised in the financial statements. The Group did not early adopt any o f IFRS 9 in \\nprevious  periods.  \\nAs permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the Group elected not to restate comparative figures. \\nAny adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were \\nrecognised  in the opening retained earnings and other reserves of the current period. The Group has also \\nelected to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 on adoption of  IFRS 9.  \\nConsequently, for notes disclosures, the consequential amendments  to IFRS 7 disclosures have also only \\nbeen applied to the current period. The comparative period notes disclosures repeat those disclosures \\nmade in the prior year.  \\n The adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in changes in our accounting policies for recognition,  classification \\nand measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and impairment of financial assets.

Any ineffectiveness is recognised in profit \\nor loss.  \\n The total remeasurement loss of CU 983,000 was recog nised in opening reserves  at 1 January 2018.  In \\naddition,  an amount of CU 120 ,000 was reclassified from retai ned earnings to other reserves at 1 January \\n2018  in respect of cumulative own credit a djustment s on fina ncial liabilities designated at fair value \\nthrough profit and loss.  \\n \\n The following explains how applying the new classification requirements of IFRS 9 led to changes in \\nclassification of certain financial assets held by the Group as shown in the table above:  \\n  \\n (A) Debt instruments previously classified as available fo r sale but which fail the SPPI test  \\n The Group holds a portfolio of debt instruments that failed to meet the ‘solely payments of principal and \\ninterest’ (SPPI) requirement for amortised cost classification under IFRS 9. These instruments contain \\nprovision s that, in certain circumstances, can allow the issuer to defer interest payments, but which do not \\naccrue additional interest. This clause breaches the criterion that interest payments should only be \\nconsideration  for credit risk and the time value of mon ey on the principal. As a result,  these instruments, \\nwhich amounted to CU 455,000, were classified as FVPL from the date of initial  application.  \\n  \\n (B) Securities within the liquidity portfolio  \\n After assessing its business model for securities within t he Group’s liquidity portfolio, which are mostly \\nheld to collect the contractual cash flows and sell, the Group has identified certain securities which are \\nmanaged separately and for which the past practice has been (and the Group’s intention remains) to h old \\nto collect the contractual cash flows. Consequently, the Group assessed that the appropriate business \\nmodel for this group of securities is held to collect. These securities, which amounted to CU 341,000 and \\nwhich were previously classified as availabl e for sale, were classified as amortised cost from the date of \\ninitial application. The remainder of the Group’s liquidity portfolio is held to collect contractual cash flows \\nand sell.  ', ' \\nIFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures   PwC \\uf0b7 14  (C) Syndicated loans  \\n The Group acted as the lead arranger of a synd icated loan facility to one of its major customers. The \\nfacility amount requested by the customer exceeded the Group’s limit for single client exposure under the \\nGroup credit risk policy, so the facility was approved with the condition that the excess amou nt of CU \\n6,541,000 be sold in the medium term. Under IFRS 9, this amount exceeding the Group’s limit is classified \\nas part of a hold to sell business model and measured at FVPL. The loan was previously measured at \\namortised cost in its entirety.  \\n  \\n (D) Investments in convertible loan notes  \\n The Group holds investments  in convertible loan notes of CU 102,000 which are not traded in an active \\nmarket. These were accounted for previously as hybrid instruments with (i) the equity conversion feature \\nrepresenti ng an embedded derivative separately accounted for at fair value through profit or loss \\n(presented together with Investment Securities) and (ii) the debt host classified as a loan and receivable \\nand measured  at amortised cost. Under IFRS 9, the instruments  are assessed as a whole and, due to the \\nequity conversion feature, failed the SPPI test. Consequently, the instruments are now measured at FVPL \\nin their entirety.  \\n  \\n (E) Investments in asset -backed  securities  \\n The Group holds investments in a portfolio  of fixed rate securities backed by real estate property loans \\nwhich were issued by a special purpose entity. After performing detailed analysis, the Group concluded \\nthat these investments do not pass the SPPI test given the notes form part of one of the m ore \\nsubordinated tranches issued by the special purpose entity, so that the exposure to credit risk of the \\ninvestment is greater than the exposure to credit risk of the underlying asset pool as a whole. As a result, \\nthis portfolio of securities, which were  previously classified as available -for-sale and amounted to CU \\n654,000, have been reclassified to FVPL.  \\n  \\n (F) Investment in debt securities previously designated at fair value through profit or loss  \\nIFRS7(42I)(c)  \\nIFRS7(42J)(b)  The Group holds an inves tment of CU 310,000 in a portfolio of debt securities which had previously been \\ndesignated at fair value through profit or loss as the debt securities were managed on a fair value basis. \\nAs part of the transition  to IFRS 9, these securities are part of an ‘other’  business model and so required to \\nbe classified as FVPL, instead of designated FVPL.  \\n  \\n (G) De -designation of investment in debt instrument previously designated at fair value through \\nprofit or loss  \\nIFRS7(42I)(c)  \\nIFRS7(42J)(b)  The Group holds de bt instruments amounting to CU 236,000 equivalent which had previously been \\ndesignated at FVPL to reduce an accounting mismatch with derivatives used in an economic hedge of \\ninterest rate risk. The Group has chosen to de -designate these financial assets up on transition to IFRS 9 \\nand measure  them at amortised cost as, subsequent to initial recognition, the Group has economically \\noffset the original exposure with debt securities and, consequently, terminated the derivatives previously \\nused in the economic hed ge. \\nIFRS7(42N)  The effective interest rate of these debt instruments is 8.5% per annum and CU 20,000 of interest income \\nhas been recognised during the year.  \\nIFRS7(42N)  PwC observation – Disclosures of EIR and interest income for financial assets and liab ilities \\nreclassified out of FVPL category on transition to IFRS 9  \\nIf an entity treats the fair value of a financial asset or a financial liability as the new gross carrying amount \\nat the date of initial application (when allowed by paragraph 7.2.11 of IFRS  9), the disclosure above shall \\nbe made for each reporting period until derecognition. If an entity does not, these disclosures need not be \\nmade after the annual reporting period in which the entity initially applies the classification and \\nmeasurement requ irements for financial assets in IFRS 9.  ', ' \\nIFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures   PwC \\uf0b7 15  (H) Designation of equity instruments at FVOCI  \\nThe Group has elected to irrevocably designate strategic investments of CU 450,000 in a small portfolio of \\nnon-trading equity securities in clearing houses and exchan ges at FVOCI as permitted under IFRS 9. \\nThese securities were previously classified as available for sale. The changes in fair value of such \\nsecurities will no longer be reclassified to profit or loss when they are disposed of.  \\n  \\n (I) Reclassification fr om retired categories with no change in measurement  \\nIn addition to the above, the following debt instruments have been reclassified to new categories under \\nIFRS 9, as their previous categories under IAS 39 were ‘retired’, with no changes to their \\nmeasureme nt basis:  \\n(i) Those previously classified as available for sale and now classified as measured at FVOCI ; and \\n(ii) Those previously classified as held to maturity and now classified as measured at amortised  cost. \\nIFRS7(42M)  For financial assets and liabilities that  have been reclassified to the amortised cost category, the following \\ntable shows their fair value as at 31 December 2018 and the fair value gain or loss that would have been \\nrecognised if these financial assets and liabilities had not been reclassified as  part of the transition to \\nIFRS  9: \\n \\nReclassifications to amortised cost  2018  \\n CU’000  \\nFrom available -for-sale (IAS 39 classification) – Item (B) above   \\nFair value as at 31 December 2018  378 \\nFair value gain/(loss) that would have been recognised during the year if the financial asset \\nhad not been reclassified  37 \\nFrom designated at fair value through profit or loss (IA S 39 classification) – \\nItem (G) above   \\nFair value as at 31 December 2018  210 \\nFair value gain/(loss) that would have been recognised duri ng the year if the financial asset \\nhad not been reclassified  (26) \\n \\nDisclosures not illustrated as not applicable to the Group  \\nThe same information included in the table above should be provided, when applicable, for financial assets \\nthat have been reclass ified out of FVPL category to FVOCI.  \\n  ', ' \\nIFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures   PwC \\uf0b7 16 IFRS7(42P)  (c) Reconciliation of impairment allowance balance from IAS 39 to IFRS 9  \\n The following table reconciles the prior period’s closing impairment allowance measured in accordance \\nwith the IAS 39 incurred los s model to the new impairment allowance measured in accordance with the \\nIFRS 9 expected loss model at 1 January 2018:  \\n \\nMeasurement category  Loan loss \\nallowance \\nunder IAS \\n39/Provision \\nunder IAS 37  Reclassi fication  Remeasurement  Loan loss \\nallowance \\nunder IF RS 9  \\n CU’000  CU’000  CU’000  CU’000  \\nLoans and receivables (IAS 39) /Financial assets at amortised cost (IFRS 9)  \\nCash and balances with central \\nbanks  – – – – \\nLoans and advances to  Banks  – – 58 58 \\nLoans and advances \\nto Customers  3,001  (65) 987 3,923  \\nInves tment securities  – – 7 7 \\nTotal  3,001  (65) 1,052  3,988  \\nHeld to maturity (IAS 39) /Financial assets at amortised cost (IFRS 9)  \\nInvestment securities  – – 10 10 \\nAvailable for sale financial instruments (IAS 39) /Financial assets at FVOCI (IFRS 9)  \\nInvestment  securities  – – 1 1 \\nLoan commitments and financial guarantee contracts  \\nLoans and advances to \\nCustomers  (Loan commitments)  – – 7 7 \\nProvisions (Loan commitments)  – – 3 3 \\nProvisions (Financial \\nguarantees)  – – 65 65 \\nTotal  3,001  (65) 1,138  4,074  \\n \\nFurther information on the measurement of the impairment allowance under IFRS 9 can be found in \\nnote 3.1.2.  \\nIFRS7(42R),  \\n(42S)  Disclosures not illustrated as not applicable to the Group  \\nAdditional disclosures need to be made if the entity takes  advantage of the spe cific exemptions set out in \\nparagraphs 7.2.4 and 7.2.5 of IFRS 9.

In particular, the IAS 39 accounting policies \\napplied in the prior period and IFRS 13 policies relating to the measurement  of fair value in both periods \\nare not repeated here,  but will need to be presented.  \\n This note sets out the significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidat ed \\nfinancial statements.  \\n 1.2.1  Financial assets and liabilities  \\n Measurement methods  \\n Amortised cost and effective interest rate  \\nIFRS9(App A)  The amortised cost is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial \\nrecognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective \\ninterest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial \\nassets, adjusted for any loss allowance.  \\n The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts \\nthrough the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability to the gross carrying amount of a \\nfinancial asset (i.e. its amortised cost before  any impairment allowance) or to the amortised cost of a \\nfinancial liability. The calculation does not consider expected credit losses  and includes transaction costs, \\npremiums or discounts and fees and points paid or received that are integral to the effec tive interest rate, \\nsuch as origination fees. For purchased or originated credit -impaired (‘POCI’) financial assets – assets \\nthat are credit -impaired (see definition on note 3.1.2.2) at initial recognition – the Group calculates the \\ncredit -adjusted effecti ve interest rate, which is calculated based on the amortised cost of the financial \\nassetinstead of its gross carrying amount and incorporates the impact of expected credit losses in \\nestimated future cash flows.  \\n When the Group revises the estimates of fut ure cash flows, the carrying amount of the respective financial \\nassets or financial liability is adjusted to reflect the new estimate discounted using the original effective \\ninterest rate. Any chan ges are recognised in profit or  loss. \\n Interest income  \\nIFRS9(5.4.1)  Interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of \\nfinancial assets , except for:  \\n(a) POCI financial assets, for which the original credit -adjusted effective interest rate is applied to the \\namortised  cost of the financial asset.  \\n(b) Financial assets that are not ‘POCI’ but have subsequently become credit -impaired (or ‘stage 3’), for \\nwhich interest revenue is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to their amortised cost (i.e. \\nnet of the expect ed credit loss provision).  \\n Initial recognition and measurement  \\nIFRS9(3.1.1)  \\nIFRS9(3.1.2)  Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes a party  to the contractual \\nprovisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and  sales of financial assets are recognised on \\ntrade -date, the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.  ', ' \\nIFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures   PwC \\uf0b7 18 IFRS9(5.1.1)  At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset or financial liability at its fair value plus or minus, \\nin the case of a financial asset or financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that \\nare incremental and directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability, \\nsuch as fees and co mmissions. Transaction costs of financial assets and financial liabilities carried at fair \\nvalue through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss. Immediately after initial recognition, an expected \\ncredit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for financi al assets measured at amortised cost and investments in \\ndebt instruments measured at FVOCI, as described in note 3.1.2, which results in an accounting loss being \\nrecognised in profit or loss when an asset is newly  originated.  \\nIFRS 9  \\n(B5.1.2A)  When the fai r value of financial assets and liabilities differs from the transaction price on initial recognition, \\nthe entity recogn ises the difference as follows:  \\n(a) When the fair value is evidenced by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liabili ty \\n(i.e. a Level 1 input) or based on a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, \\nthe difference is recognised as a gain or loss.  \\n(b) In all other cases, the difference is deferred and the timing of recognition of deferred day one profit  or \\nloss is determined individually. It is either amortised over the life of the instrument, deferred until the \\ninstrument’s fair value can be determined using market observable inputs, or realised through \\nsettlement.  \\n 1.2.1.1 Financial assets  \\n (i) Class ification and subsequent measurement  \\nIFRS9(4.1.1)  From 1 January 2018, the Group has applied IFRS 9 and classifies its financial assets in the following \\nmeasurement categories:  \\n\\uf0b7 Fair value through profit or loss (FVPL);  \\n\\uf0b7 Fair value through other comprehensi ve income (FVOCI); or  \\n\\uf0b7 Amortised cost.  \\n The classification requirements for debt and equity instruments are described below:  \\n Debt instruments  \\n Debt instruments are those instruments that meet the definition of a financial liability from the issuer’s \\nperspective, such as loans, government and corporate bonds and trade receivables purchased from \\nclients in factoring arrangements without recourse.  \\nIFRS9(5.1.1)  Classification and subsequent measurement of debt instruments depend on:  \\n(i) the Group’s business mo del for managing the asset ; and \\n(ii) the cash flow characteristics of the asset.  \\nBased on these factors, the Group classifies its debt instruments into one of the following three \\nmeasurement categories:  \\nIFRS9(4.1.2)  \\uf0b7 Amortised cost: Assets that are held for co llection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows \\nrepresent solely payments of principal and interest (‘SPPI’), and that are not designated at FVPL, are \\nmeasured at amortised cost.  The carrying amount of these assets is adjusted by any expected cre dit \\nloss allowance recognised and measured as described in note 3.1.2. Interest income from these \\nfinancial assets is included in ‘Interest and similar income’ using the effective interest rate method.  \\nIFRS9(4.1.2A)  \\uf0b7 Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI): Financial assets that are held for collection \\nof contractual cash flows and for selling the assets, where the assets’ cash flows represent solely \\npayments of principal and interest, and that are not designated at FVPL, are measured at fair value \\nthrough other comprehensive income (FVOCI). Movements in the carrying amount are taken through \\nOCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest revenue and foreign exchange \\ngains and losses on the instrument’s amortised cost wh ich are recognised in profit or loss. When the \\nfinancial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified \\nfrom equity to profit or loss and recognised in ‘Net Investment income’. Interest income from these \\nfinancial assets is included in ‘Interest income’ using the effective interest rate method.  ', ' \\nIFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures   PwC \\uf0b7 19 IFRS9(4.1.4)  \\n \\uf0b7 Fair value through profit or loss: Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are \\nmeasured at fair value through profit or loss. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently \\nmeasured at fair value through profit or loss and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in \\nprofit or loss and presented in the profit or loss statement within ‘Net trading income’ in th e period in \\nwhich it arises, unless it arises from debt instruments that were designated at fair value or which are \\nnot held for trading, in which case they are presented separately in ‘Net investment income’. Interest \\nincome from these financial assets is  included in ‘Interest income’ us ing the effective interest \\nrate method.  \\nIFRS9  \\n(B4.1.2.A) , \\n(B4.1.2.B)  Business model:  the business model reflects how the Group manages the assets in order to generate \\ncash flows. That is, whether the Group’s objective is solely to collect the contractual cash flows from the \\nassets or is to collect both the contractual cash flows and cash flows arising from the sale of assets. If \\nneither of these is applicable (e.g. financial assets are held for trading purposes), then the f inancial assets \\nare classified as part of ‘other’ business model  and measured at FVPL. Factors considered by the Group \\nin determining the business model for a group of assets include past experience on how the cash flows for \\nthese assets were collected,  how the asset’s performance is evaluated and reported to key management \\npersonnel, how risks are assessed and managed and how managers are compensated. For example, the \\nGroup’s business model for the mortgage loan book is to hold to collect contractual cash flows, with sales \\nof loans only being made internally to a consolidated SPV for the purposes of collateralising notes issued, \\nwith no resulting derecognition by the Group. Another example is the liquidity portfolio of assets, which is \\nheld by the Group as part of liquidity management and is generally classified within the hold to collect and \\nsell business model. Securities held for trading are held principally for the purpose of selling in the near \\nterm or are part of a portfolio of financial instruments th at are managed together and for which there is \\nevidence of a recent actual pattern of short -term profit -taking. These securities are classified in the ‘other’ \\nbusiness model and measured at FVPL.  \\nIFRS9  (B4.1.7A)  SPPI:  Where the business model is to hold a ssets to collect contractual cash flows or to collect contractual \\ncash flows and sell, the Group assesses whether the financial instruments’ cash  flows represent solely \\npayments of principal and interest (the ‘SPPI test’). In making this assessment, the Gr oup considers \\nwhether the contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic lending arrangement i.e. interest includes  \\nonly consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks and a profit margin that \\nis consistent with a bas ic lending arrangement. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or \\nvolatility that are inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and \\nmeasured at fair value through profit or loss.  \\n PwC observat ion – Significant accounting judgements in determining business model and \\napplying SPPI test  \\nDetermining the appropriate business model and assessing whether cash flows generated by an asset \\nconstitute solely payments of principal and interest is sometimes  complex and may require significant \\njudgement. Depending on the level of judgement and the amount of  financial assets affected by the \\nconclusion, the SPPI and/or  business model assessment may require disclosure as a significant \\njudgement in accordance wit h paragraph 122 of IAS 1. For example, a judgement on whether or not a \\ncontractual clause in all loans of a certain type (e.g. all residential mortgages) breaches SPPI and results \\nin a material portfolio being recorded at FVPL.  \\nIFRS9(4.3.2),  \\n(4.3.3)  Finan cial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether \\ntheir cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.  \\nIFRS9(4.4.1)  The Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for m anaging those \\nassets changes. The reclassification takes place from the start of the first reporting period following the \\nchange. Such changes are expected to be very infrequent and none occurred during the period.  \\n \\n  ', ' \\nIFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures   PwC \\uf0b7 20 IFRS9(4.1.5)  Disclosures not illustra ted as not applicable to the Group  \\n The following is a possible accounting policy for fair value option for financial assets, which was not \\nincluded as not used by the Group:  \\n Fair value option for financial assets  \\n The Group may also irrevocably design ate financial assets at fair value through profit or loss if doing so \\nsignificantly reduces or eliminates a mismatch created by assets and liabilities being measured on \\ndifferent bases .  \\n Equity instruments  \\nIAS32R(11)  Equity instruments are instruments that meet the definition of equity from the issuer’s perspective ; that is, \\ninstruments that do not contain a contractual obligation to pay and that evidence a residual interest in the \\nissuer’s net assets. Examples of equity instruments include basic ordina ry shares.  \\nIFRS9(5.7.2)  The Group subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value through profit or loss, except where \\nthe Group’s management has elected, at initial recognition, to irrevocably designate an equity investment \\nat fair value throu gh other comprehensive income. The Group’s policy is to designate equity investments \\nas FVOCI when those investments are held for purposes other than to generate investment returns. When \\nthis election is used , fair value gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are not subsequently \\nreclassified to profit or loss, including on disposal. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) \\nare not reported separately from other changes in fair value. Dividends, when representing a return on \\nsuch investment s, continue to be recognised in profit or loss as other income when the Group’s right to \\nreceive payments is established.  \\nGains and losses on equity investments at FVPL are included in the ‘Net trading income’ line in the \\nstatement of profit or loss.  \\n (ii) Impairment  \\nIFRS9(5.5.17)  The Group assesses on a forward -looking basis the expected credit losses (‘ECL’) associated with its debt \\ninstrument assets carried at amortised cost and FVOCI and with the exposure arising from loan \\ncommitments and financial gu arantee contracts. The Group recognises a loss allowance for such losses at \\neach reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects:  \\n\\uf0b7 An unbiased and probability -weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible \\noutcomes;  \\n\\uf0b7 The time value of m oney; and  \\n\\uf0b7 Reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting \\ndate about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.  \\nNote 3.1.2 provides more detail of how the expected cre dit loss allowance is measured.  \\n (iii) Modification of loans  \\nIFRS9(5.4.3)  The Group sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of loans to \\ncustomers. When this happens, the Group assesses whether or not the new terms are \\nsubstantially  different to the original terms. The Group does this by considering, among others, the \\nfollowing factors:  \\n\\uf0b7 If the borrower  is in financial difficulty, whether the modification merely reduces the contractual cash \\nflows to amounts the borrower is e xpected to be able to pay.  \\n\\uf0b7 Whether any substantial new terms are introduced, such as a profit share /equity -based  return that \\nsubstantially affects the risk profile of the loan.  \\n\\uf0b7 Significant extension of the loan term when the borrower is not in financial di fficulty.  \\n\\uf0b7 Significant change in the interest rate.  \\n\\uf0b7 Change in the currency the loan is denominated in.  \\n\\uf0b7 Insertion of collateral, other security or credit enhancements that significantly affect the credit risk \\nassociated with the loan.  ', ' \\nIFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures   PwC \\uf0b7 21 IFRS9(B5.5.25 ), \\n(B5.5. 26)  If the terms are substantially different, the Group derecognises the original financial asset and recognises \\na ‘new’ asset at fair value and recalculates a new effective interest rate for the asset. The date of \\nrenegotiation is consequently considered  to be the date of initial recognition for impairment calculation \\npurposes, including for the purpose of determining whether a significant increase in credit risk has \\noccurred. However, the Group also assesses whether the new financial asset recognised is deemed to be \\ncredit -impaired at initial recognition, especially in circumstances where the renegotiation was driven by the \\ndebtor being unable to make the originally agreed payments. Differences in the carrying amount are also \\nrecognised in profit or loss as a gain or loss on derecognition.  \\nIFRS9(5.4.3)  If the terms are not substantially different, the renegotiation or modification does not result in \\nderecognition, and the Group recalculates the gross carrying amount based on the revised cash flows of \\nthe financial asset and recognises a modification gain or loss in profit or loss. The new gross carrying \\namount is recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original effective interest  rate (or \\ncredit -adjusted effective interest rate for purch ased or originated credit -impaired financial assets).  \\n The impact of modifications of financial assets on the expected credit loss c alculation is discussed in \\nnote 3.1.5.  \\n PwC observation – Derecognition of revolving products  \\nThe derecognition assessment  for revolving products, such as credit cards and overdrafts, is a complex \\narea which requires significant judgement in applying the IFRS 9 requirements. Therefore, additional \\ndisclosures would be expected about the accounting policies applied to such prod ucts where these are \\nrelevant to the entity.  \\n (iv) Derecognition other than on a modification  \\nIFRS9(3.2.3)  Financial assets, or a portion thereof, are derecognised when the contractual rights to receive the cash \\nflows from the assets have expired, or whe n they have been transferred and either (i) the Group transfers \\nsubstantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, or (ii) the Group neither transfers nor retains \\nsubstantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and the Group has not retained contro l. \\nIFRS9(3.2.5)  The Group enters into transactions where it retains the contractual rights to receive cash flows from assets \\nbut assumes a contractual obligation to pay those cash flows to other entities and transfers substantially \\nall of the risks and re wards. These transactions are accounted for as ‘pass through’ transfers that result in \\nderecognition if the Group:  \\n(i) Has no obligation to make payments unless it colle cts equivalent amounts from the  assets;  \\n(ii) Is prohibited from selling or pledging the assets; and \\n(iii) Has an obligation to remit any cash it collects from the assets without material  delay.  \\n Collateral (shares and bonds) furnished by the Group under standard repurchase agreements and \\nsecurities lending and borrowing transactions are not derecognised b ecause the Group retains \\nsubstantially all the risks and rewards on the basis of the predetermined repurchase price, and the criteria \\nfor derecognition are therefore not met. This also applies to certain securitisation  transactions in which the \\nGroup retai ns a subordinated residual interest.  \\n 1.2.1. 2 Financial liabilities  \\n (i) Classification and subsequent measurement  \\nIFRS9(4.2.1)  \\nIFRS9(B5.7.16)  In both the current and prior period, financial liabilities are classified as subsequently measured at \\namortised cost,  except for:  \\n\\uf0b7 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss: this classification is applied to derivatives, \\nfinancial liabilities held for trading (e.g. short positions in the trading booking) and other financial \\nliabilities designated as such at initial recognition. Gains or losses on financial liabilities designated at \\nfair value through profit or loss are presented partially in other comprehensive income (the amount of \\nchange in the fair value of the financial liability that is attributable t o changes in the credit risk of that \\nliability, which is determined as the amount that is not attributable to changes in market conditions that \\ngive rise to market risk) and partially profit or loss (the remaining amount of change in the fair value of \\nthe liability). This is unless such a presentation would create, or enlarge, an accounting mismatch, in ', ' \\nIFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures   PwC \\uf0b7 22 which case the gains and losses attributable to changes in the credit risk of the liability are also \\npresented in profit or loss;  \\n\\uf0b7 Financial liabilities aris ing from the transfer  of financial assets which did not qualify for derecognition, \\nwhereby a financial liability is recognised for the consideration received for the transfer. In subsequent \\nperiods, the Group recognises any expense incurred on the financia l liability; and  \\n\\uf0b7 Financial guarantee contracts  and loan commitments (see note 1.3).  \\n (ii) Derecognition  \\nIFRS9(3.3.1)  Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished (i.e. when the obligation specified in the \\ncontract is discharged, canc elled or expires).  \\nIFRS9(3.3.2), \\n(3.3.3),  \\n(B3.3.6)  The exchange between the Group and its original lenders of debt instruments with substantially different \\nterms, as well as substantial modifications of the terms of existing financial liabilities, are acc ounted for as \\nan extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. The terms \\nare substantially different if the discounted present value of the cash flows under the new terms, including \\nany fees paid net o f any fees received and discounted using the original effective interest rate, is at least \\n10% different from the discounted present value of the remaining cash flows of the original financial \\nliability. In addition, other qualitative factors, such as the currency that the instrument is denominated in, \\nchanges in the type of interest rate, new conversion features attached to the instrument and change in \\ncovenants are also taken into consideration. If an exchange of debt instruments or modification of terms is \\naccounted for as an extinguishment, any costs or fees incurred are recognised as part of the gain or loss \\non the extinguishment. If the exchange or modification is not accounted for as an extinguishment, any \\ncosts or fees incurred adjust the carrying am ount of the liability and are amortised over the remaining term \\nof the modified liability.  \\n 1.2.2  Financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments  \\nIFRS9  \\n(Appendix A)  Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to \\nreimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due, in \\naccordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Such financial guarantees are given to banks, financial \\ninstitutions and others on behalf o f customers to secure loans, overdrafts  and other banking  facilities.  \\nIFRS9(4.2.1)  Financial guarantee contracts are initially measured at fair value and subs equently measured at the \\nhigher  of: \\n\\uf0b7 The amount of the loss allowance (calculated as described in note 3.1.2) ; and \\n\\uf0b7 The premium received on initial recognition less income recognised in accordance with the prin ciples \\nof IFRS 15.  \\nIFRS9(2.3)  Loan commitments provided by the Group are measured as the amount of  the loss allowance \\n(calculated  as described i n note 3.1.2). The Group has not provided any c ommitment to provide loans \\nat a below -market interest rate, or that can be settled net in cash or by deliveri ng or issuing another \\nfinancial  instrument.  \\nIFRS7(B8E)  For loan commitments and financial guarantee  contracts,  the loss allowance is recognised as a provision. \\nHowever, for contracts that include both a loan and an undrawn commitment and the Group cannot \\nseparately identify the expected credit losses on the undrawn commitment component from those on the  \\nloan component, the expected credit losses on the undrawn commitment are recognised together with the \\nloss allowance for the loan. To the extent that the combined expected credit losses exceed the gross \\ncarrying amount of the loan, the expected credit los ses are recognised as a  provision.  \\n 1.2.3  Derivatives and hedging activities  \\nIFRS9(7.2.21)  The Group has elected to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 on adoption of \\nIFRS 9.  \\nIFRS7(44Z)  The Group has not provided comparative in formation for periods before the date of initial application of \\nIFRS 9 for the new disclosures introduced by IFRS 9 as a consequential amendment to IFRS 7, as \\npermitted by IFRS 7 paragraph 44Z.  ', ' \\nIFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures   PwC \\uf0b7 23  Disclosures not illustrated as not applicable to the Group  \\nFor the purposes of these Illustrative financial statements, the Group has not adopted the new hedge \\naccounting requirements of IFRS 9. Nevertheless, the rev ised hedge accounting disclosures introduced by \\nthe consequential amendments to IFRS 7 are applicabl e whether or not an entity has adopted the hedge \\naccounting requirements of IFRS 9 and are therefore illustrated in note 4.  \\nWhere banks choose to adopt the new hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9, they will need to \\ndisclose different accounting policie s along with an explanation  of the resulting impacts.  \\nIFRS9(4.1.4),  \\n(4.2.1a)  Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is entered into \\nand are subsequently remeasured at fair value. All derivatives are  carried as assets when fair value is \\npositive and as liabilities when fair value is negative.  \\nIFRS9(4.3.2)  \\nIFRS9(4.3.3)  Certain derivatives are embedded in hybrid  contracts, such as the conversion option in a convertible bond. \\nIf the hybrid contract cont ains a host that is a financial asset, then  the Group assesses  the entire contract \\nas described in the financial assets section above for classification and measurement purposes. \\nOtherwise, the embedded derivatives are treated as separate derivatives when:  \\n(i) Their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract;  \\n(ii) A separate instrument with the same terms would meet the definition of a derivative ; and \\n(iii) The hybrid contract is not measured at fair value through profit or lo ss. \\nThese embedded derivatives are separately accounted for at fair value, with changes in fair value \\nrecognised in the statement of profit or loss unless the Group chooses to designate the hybrid contracts at \\nfair value through profit or loss.  \\nIAS39p86  The method of recognising the resulting fair value gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is \\ndesignated and qualifies as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. \\nThe Group designates certain derivatives as either:  \\n (a) Hedg es of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or firm commitments (fair value  hedges);  \\n (b) Hedges of highly probable future cash flows attributable to a recognised asset or liability (cash flow \\nhedges); or  \\n (c) Hedges of a net investment in a foreign  operation (net investment hedges).  \\nIAS39p88  The Group documents, at the inception of the hedge, the relationship between hedged items and hedging \\ninstruments, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge \\ntransaction s. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing \\nbasis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting \\nchanges in fair  values or cash flows of hedged  items.  \\nIAS39p89  (a) Fair value hedge  \\n Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded \\nin the statement of profit or loss, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that \\nare a ttribu table to the hedged risk.  \\nIAS39p92  If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a \\nhedged item for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to profit or loss over the period to \\nmaturity and r ecorded as net interest income.  ', ' \\nIFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures   PwC \\uf0b7 24 IAS39p95  (b) Cash flow hedge  \\nIAS39p95  \\nIAS39p100, \\nIAS39p101  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash \\nflow hedges is recognised in other comprehensi ve income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective \\nportion is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss.  \\n Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled to the statement of profit or loss in the periods when the \\nhedged item affects profit  or loss. They are recorded in the income or expense lines in which the revenue \\nor expense associated with the related hedged item is reported.  \\n When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge \\naccountin g, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised \\nin the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer \\nexpected to occur (for example,  the recognised hedged as set is disposed of ), the cumulative gain or loss \\npreviously recognised in other comprehensive income is immediately reclassified to the statement of profit \\nor loss.  \\nIAS39p102  (c) Net investment hedge  \\n Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are a ccounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain \\nor loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised directly in \\nother comprehensive income; the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised i mmediately \\nin the statement of profit or loss. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the statement of \\nprofit or loss when the foreign operation is disposed of as part of the gain or loss on the disposal.  \\n \\n2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements  \\nIAS1(122),  (125)  The preparation of financial statements requires the use of accounting estimates which, by definition, will \\nseldom equal the actual results. Management also needs to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s \\naccounting poli cies. \\n This note provides an overview of the areas that involve a higher degree of judgement or complexity, and \\nmajor sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment \\nwithin the next financial year. Deta iled information about each of these estimates and judgements is \\nincluded in the related notes together with information about the basis of calculation for each affected line \\nitem in the financial statements.  \\n Measurement of the expected credit loss allow ance  \\n The measurement of the expected credit loss allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost \\nand FVOCI is an area that requires the use of complex models and significant assumptions about future \\neconomic conditions and credit behaviour (e.g . the likelihood of customers defaulting and the resulting \\nlosses). Explanation of the inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques used in measuring ECL is \\nfurther detailed in note 3.1.2.3, which also sets out key sensitivities  of the ECL to changes in \\nthese  elements.  \\nA number of significant judgements are also required in applying the accounting requirements for \\nmeasuring ECL, such as:  \\n\\uf0b7 Determining criteria for significant increase in credit risk;  \\n\\uf0b7 Choosing appropriate models and assumptions for the measur ement of ECL;  \\n\\uf0b7 Establishing the number and relative weighting s of forward -looking  scenarios for each type of \\nproduct/market and the associated ECL; and  \\n\\uf0b7 Establishing  groups of similar financial assets for the purposes of measuring ECL.  \\nDetailed information about the  judgements and estimates made by the Group in the above areas is set out \\nin note 3.1.2.  \\n ', ' \\nIFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures   PwC \\uf0b7 25  PwC observation  \\nSignificant judgements in measuring ECL  \\nNot all the significant judgements listed above may be relevant to all Banks. Conversely, judgements not \\nlisted above may be significant for some Banks, for example determining the relevant period of exposure \\nto credit risk when measuring ECL for credit cards and revolving credit facilities. The disclosure provided \\nshould, therefore,  be tailored appropriately.  \\nBusiness models and SPPI as significant judgments  \\nAs well as ECL, determining the appropriate business models and assessing the SPPI requirements for \\nfinancial assets may require significant accounting judgement and have a significant impact on the \\nfinancia l statements, as discussed in note 1.2.1.1(i). When this is the case, these judgements should also \\nbe disclosed or cross -referenced in this section.  \\n \\n3. Financial risk management  \\n PwC observation – Comparative disclosures  \\nIFRS 9 introduced and modified se veral disclosure requirements in IFRS 7 in relation to credit risk and \\nimpairment of financial instruments. These new disclosures are not required to be provided for the \\ncomparative period if a bank chooses not to restate the prior period in accordance wit h the exemption \\nprovided in IFRS 9 paragraph 7.2.15. Consequently, all disclosures required by the previous version of \\nIFRS 7 should be provided in respect of the comparative period. Such disclosures have not been \\nillustrated in this document.  \\n The follow ing section discusses the Group’s risk management policies. The measurement of ECL under \\nIFRS 9 uses the information and approaches that the Group uses to manage credit risk, though certain \\nadjustments are made in order to comply with the requirements of I FRS 9. The approach taken for IFRS 9 \\nmeasurement purposes is discussed separately in note 3.1.2.  \\n 3.1 Credit risk  \\nIFRS7(33)(a)  Credit risk is the risk of suffering financial loss, should any of the Group’s customers, clients or market \\ncounterparties fail  to fulfil their contractual obligations to the Group. Credit risk arises mainly from \\ninterbank, commercial and consumer loans and advances, and loan commitments arising from such \\nlending activities, but can also arise from credit enhancement provided, suc h as credit derivatives ( credit \\ndefault swaps), financial guarantees, letters of credit, endorsements and acceptances.  \\nThe Group is also exposed to other credit risks arising from investments in debt securities and other \\nexposures arising from its trading activities (‘trading exposures’) including non -equity trading portfolio \\nassets  and derivatives as well as settlement balances with market counte rparties and reverse \\nrepurchase  agreements.  \\nCredit risk is the single largest risk for the Group’s business; man agement therefore carefully manages its \\nexposure to credit risk. The credit risk management and control are centralised in a credit risk \\nmanagement team which reports regularly to the Board of Directors and head of each business unit.  \\nIFRS7  (33)(b)  3.1.1  Credit risk measurement  \\n (a) Loans and advances ( incl. loan commitments and guarantees)  \\n The estimation of credit exposure for risk management purposes is complex and requires the use of \\nmodels, as the exposure varies with changes in market conditions, e xpected cash flows and the passage \\nof time. The assessment of credit risk of a portfolio of assets entails further estimations as to the likelihood \\nof defaults occurring, of the associated loss ratios and of default correlations between counterparties. The  \\nGroup measures credit risk using Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD) and Loss Given \\nDefault (LGD). This is similar to the approach used for the purposes of measuring Expected Credit Loss \\n(ECL) under IFRS 9.  Refer to note 3.1.2 for more details.  ', ' \\nIFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures   PwC \\uf0b7 26  Credit risk grading  \\nThe Group uses internal credit risk gradings  that reflect its assessment  of the probability of default of \\nindividual counterparties. The Group use internal rating models tailored to the various categories of \\ncounterparty . Borrower and loan specific information collected at the time of application (such as \\ndisposable income, and level of collateral for retail exposures; and turnover and industry type for \\nwholesale exposures) is fed into this rating model. This is supplemented w ith external data such as credit \\nbureau scoring information on individual borrowers. In addition, the models enable expert judgement from \\nthe Credit Risk Officer to be fed into the final internal credit rating for each exposure. This allows for \\nconsiderati ons which may not be captured as part of the other data inputs into the  model.  \\nThe credit grades are calibrated such that the risk of default increases exponentially at each higher risk \\ngrade. For example, this means that the difference in the PD between a n A and A - rating grade is lower \\nthan the difference in the PD between a B and B - rating grade.  \\nThe following are additional considerations for each type of portfolio held by the Group:  \\nRetail  \\nAfter the date of initial recognition, for retail business, the  payment behaviour  of the borrower is monitored \\non a periodic basis to develop a behavioural  score. Any other known information about the borrower which \\nimpact s their creditworthiness – Such as unemployment and previous delinquency history – is also \\nincorp orated into the behavioural  score. This score is mapped to a PD.  \\nWholesale  \\nFor wholesale business, the rating is determined at the borrower level.  A relationship manager will \\nincorporate any updated or new information/credit assessments into the credit sys tem on an ongoing \\nbasis. In addition, the relationship manager will also update information about the creditworthiness of the \\nborrower every year from sources such as public financial statements. This will determine the updated \\ninternal credit rating  and P D. \\nTreasury  \\nFor debt securities in the Treasury portfolio, external rating agency credit grades are used. \\nThese  published grades are continuously monitored and updated. The PD’s associated with each \\ngrade  are determined based on realised  default rates over  the prior 12 months, as published by the \\nrating  agency.  \\nThe Group’s rating method comprises 25 rating levels for instruments not in default (1 to 25) and five \\ndefault classes (26 to 30).

Please refer to note \\n3.1.2.1 for a description of how the Group determines when a significant increase in credit risk \\nhas occurred.  \\n\\uf0b7 If the financial instrument is credit -impaired, the financial inst rument is then moved to ‘Stage 3’. Please \\nrefer to note 3.1.2.2 for a description of how the Group  defines credit -impaired and default.  \\n\\uf0b7 Financial instruments in Stage 1 have their ECL measured at an amount equal to the portion of lifetime \\nexpected credit l osses that result from default events possible within the next 12 months. Instruments \\nin Stages 2 or 3 have their ECL measured based on expected credit losses on a lifetime basis. Please \\nrefer to note 3.1.2.3 for a description of inputs, assumptions and es timation techniques used in \\nmeasuring the ECL.  \\n\\uf0b7 A pervasive concept in measuring ECL in accordance with IFRS 9 is that it should consider forward -\\nlooking  information. Note 3.1.2.4 includes an explanation  of how the Group has incorporated this in its \\nECL mod els. \\n\\uf0b7 Purchased or originated credit -impaired financial assets are those financial assets that are credit -\\nimpaired on initial recognition.

If at the current reporting date the lifetime \\nPD is actually [Z]% and this exceeds the expected PD of [Y]% by more than the threshold shown above, \\nthen a significant increase in credit risk has occurred.  ', ' \\nIFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures   PwC \\uf0b7 30  These thresholds have been determined separately for Retail Mortgages, Other retail products and \\nWholesale, by assessing how the Lifetime PD moves prior to an instrument becoming delinquent. The \\nLifetime PD movements on instruments which do not subsequently become delinquent have also been \\nassessed, to identify the “natural” movement in Lifetime PD which is not considered indicative of a \\nsignificant increase in credit risk.  \\nIFRS7(35G)(a)(ii)  Qualitati ve criteria:  \\nFor Retail portfolios, if the borrower meets one or more of the following criteria:  \\n\\uf0b7 In short -term forbearance  \\n\\uf0b7 Direct debit cancellation  \\n\\uf0b7 Extension to the terms granted  \\n\\uf0b7 Previous arrears within the last [12] months  \\nFor Wholesale and Treasury port folios, if the borrower is on the Watchlist and/or the instrument meets \\none or more of the following criteria:  \\n\\uf0b7 Significant increase in credit spread  \\n\\uf0b7 Significant adverse changes in business, financial  and/or  economic c onditions in which the \\nborrower  operate s \\n\\uf0b7 Actual or expected forbearance or restructuring  \\n\\uf0b7 Actual or expected significant adverse change in operating results of the borrower  \\n\\uf0b7 Significant change in collateral value (secured facilities only) which is expected to increase risk \\nof default  \\n\\uf0b7 Early signs of cashflow /liquidity problems such as delay in servicing of trade creditors/loans  \\nThe assessment of SICR incorporates forward -looking  information (refer to note 3.1.2.4 for further \\ninformation) and is performed on a quarterly basis at a portfolio level fo r all Retail financial instruments \\nheld by the Group.

These  are instances where:  \\n\\uf0b7 The borrower is  in long-term forbearance  \\n\\uf0b7 The borrower is  deceased  \\n\\uf0b7 The borrower is  insolvent  \\n\\uf0b7 The borrower is  in breach of financial covenant(s)  \\n\\uf0b7 An active market for that financial asset has disappeared because of financial difficulties  \\n\\uf0b7 Concessions have been made by the lender relating to the borrower’s financial difficulty  \\n\\uf0b7 It is becoming probable that the borrower will enter  bankruptcy  ', ' \\nIFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures   PwC \\uf0b7 32 \\uf0b7 Financial assets are purchased or originated at a deep discount that reflects the incurred \\ncredit  losses. \\n The criteria above have been applied to all financial instruments held by the Group and are consistent \\nwith the definition of default used for internal credit risk management purposes. The default definition has \\nbeen applied consistently to model the  Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD) and Loss \\ngiven Default (LGD) throughout the Group’s expected loss calculations . \\nIFRS7(B8A)(b)  The 180 days past due default definition used for prime retail mortgages has been aligned with the \\ndefinition u sed for regulatory capital purposes. Furthermore, the Group performed an analysis which \\nshows that the cure rate (the proportion of instruments which would have moved out of default back to \\nStage 2 or Stage 1) after 90 days past due is [X]% (compared to [Y ]% after 180 days past due) and \\ntherefore 90 days past due is not considered an appropriate default definition. Therefore, the Group \\nconsiders 180 days past due to be a more appropriate default definition and has rebutted the 90 days \\npast due presumption u nder IFRS 9 for the prime retail mortgage portfolio. This rebuttal will be monitored \\nand reviewed by the Credit Risk department on an annual basis to ensure it remains appropriate.  \\nIFRS7(B8A)(c)  An instrument is considered to no longer be in default (i.e.  to have cured) when it no longer meets any of \\nthe default criteria for a consecutive period of six months. This period of six months has been determined \\nbased on an analysis which considers the likelihood of a financial instrument returning to default sta tus \\nafter cure using different possible cure definitions.  \\nIFRS7(35G)(a)  3.1.2.3 Measuring ECL – Explanation of inputs, assumptions  and estimation techniques  \\n The Expected Credit Loss (ECL) is measured on either a 12 -month (12M) or Lifetime basis dependin g on \\nwhether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred since initial recognition or whether an asset is \\nconsidered to be credit -impaired. Expected credit losses are the discounted product of the Probability of \\nDefault (PD), Exposure at Default (EA D), and Loss Given Default (LGD), defined as  follows:  \\n\\uf0b7 The PD represents the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on its financial obligation (as per “Definition \\nof default and credit -impaired ” above), either over the next 12 months (12M PD), or over  the \\nremaining lifetime (Lifetime PD) of the obligation.  \\n\\uf0b7 EAD is based on the amounts the Group expects to be owed at the time of default, over the next 12 \\nmonths (12M EAD) or over the remaining lifetime (Lifetime EAD). For example, for a revolving \\ncommitment, the Group includes the current drawn balance plus any further amount that is expected \\nto be drawn up to the current contractual limit by the time of default, should it occur.  \\n\\uf0b7 Loss Given Default (LGD) represents the Group’s expectation of the extent of loss on a defaulted \\nexposure. LGD varies by type of counterparty, type and seniority of claim and availability of collateral \\nor other credit support. LGD is expressed as a percentage loss per unit of exposure at the time of \\ndefault (EAD). LGD is calculated on a 12 -month or lifetime basis, where 12-month  LGD is the \\npercentage of loss expected to be made if the default occurs in the next 12 months and Lifetime LGD \\nis the percentage of loss expected to be made if the default occurs over the remaining expected \\nlifetime  of the loan.  \\nThe ECL is determined by projecting the PD, LGD and EAD for each future month and for each individual \\nexposure or collective segment. These three components are multiplied together and adjusted for the \\nlikelihood of survival (i.e. the exposur e has not prepaid or defaulted in an earlier month). This effectively \\ncalculates an ECL for each future month, which is then discounted back to the reporting date and \\nsummed. The discount rate used in the ECL calculation is the original effective interest rate or an \\napproximation thereof . \\nIFRS7(35G)(a)(i)  The Lifetime PD is developed by applying a maturity profile to the current 12M PD. The maturity profile \\nlooks at how defaults develop on a portfolio from the point of initial recognition throughout the li fetime of \\nthe loans. The maturity profile is based on historical observed data and is assumed to be the same \\nacross all assets within a portfolio and credit grade band. This is supported by historical analysis.  \\n The 12 -month and lifetime EADs are determin ed based on the expected payment profile , which varies by \\nproduct type.  ', ' \\nIFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures   PwC \\uf0b7 33 \\uf0b7 For amortising  products and bullet repayment loans, this is based on the contractual repayments \\nowed by the borrower over a 12month or lifetime basis. This will also be adjusted for an y expected \\noverpayments made by a borrower. Early repayment/refinance assumptions are also incorporated \\ninto the calculation . \\n\\uf0b7 For revolving products, the exposure at default is predicted by taking current drawn balance and \\nadding a “credit conversion facto r” which allows for the expected drawdown of the remaining limit by \\nthe time of default. These assumptions vary by product type and current limit utilisation  band, based \\non analysis of the Group’s recent default data.  \\nThe 12 -month and lifetime LGDs are det ermined based on the factors which impact the recoveries made \\npost defau lt. These vary by product type.  \\n\\uf0b7 For secured products, this is primarily based on collateral type and projected collateral values, \\nhistorical discounts to market/book values due to forc ed sales, time to repossession and recovery \\ncosts observed.  \\n\\uf0b7 For unsecured products, LGD’s are typically set at product level due to the limited differentiation in \\nrecoveries achieved across different borrowers. These LGD’s are influenced by collection stra tegies, \\nincluding contracted debt sales and price.  \\n Forward -looking  economic information is also included in determining the 12 -month  and lifetime PD, EAD \\nand LGD. These assumptions vary by product type. Refer to note 3.1.2.4 for an explanation of forwar d-\\nlooking information and its inclusion in ECL calculations.  \\n The assumptions underlying the ECL calculation – such as how the maturity profile of the PDs and how \\ncollateral values change etc. – are monitored and reviewed on a quarterly  basis.  \\nIFRS7(35G) (c) There have been no significant changes in estimation techniques or significant assumptions made during \\nthe reporting period.  \\nIFRS7(35G)(b)  3.1.2.4 F orward -looking  information incorporated in the ECL models  \\n The assessment of SICR and the calculation of ECL both incorporate forward -looking  information. The \\nGroup has performed historical analysis and identified the key economic variables impacting credit risk \\nand expected credit losses for each portfolio.  \\nThese economic variables and their associated im pact on the PD, EAD and LGD vary by financial \\ninstrument. Expert judgment has also been applied in this process. Forecasts of these economic \\nvariables (the “base economic scenario ”) are provided by the Group’s Economics team on a quarterly \\nbasis and provid e the best  estimate view of the economy over the next five years. After five years, to \\nproject the economic variables out for the full remaining lifetime of each instrument, a mean reversion \\napproach has been used, which means that economic variables tend to either a long run average rate \\n(e.g. for unemployment) or a long run average growth rate (e.g. GDP) over a period of two to five years. \\nThe impact of these economic variables on the PD, EAD and LGD has been determined by performing \\nstatistical regressio n analysis to understand the impact changes in these variables have had historically \\non default rates a nd on the components of LGD and  EAD.  \\nIn addition to the base economic scenario, the Group’s Economics team also provide other possible \\nscenarios along wi th scenario weightings . The number of other scenarios used is set based on the \\nanalysis of each major product type to ensure non -linearities are captured. The number of scenarios and \\ntheir attributes are reassessed at e ach reporting date. At 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2018, for all \\nbut two portfolios the Group concluded that three scenarios appropriately captured non -linearities. For \\nportfolios [X] and [Y], the Group concluded that two additional downside scenarios w ere required. The \\nscenario  weighting s are determined by a combination of statistical analysis and expert credit judgement , \\ntaking account of the range of possible outcomes  each  chosen scenario is representative of . The  \\nassessment of SICR is performed using the Lifetime PD under each of the base , and the other \\nscenarios, multiplied by the associated scenario weighting , along with qualitative and backstop indicators  \\n(see note 3.1.2.1). This determines whether the whole financial instrument is in Stage 1, Stage 2, or \\nStage 3 and hence whether 12 -month  or lifetime ECL should be recorded. Following this assessment, \\nthe Group measures ECL as either a probability weighted  12 month  ECL (Stage 1), or a probability \\nweighted lifetime ECL (Stage s 2 and 3). These probability -weighted ECLs are determined by running ', ' \\nIFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures   PwC \\uf0b7 34 each scenario through the relevant ECL model and multiplying it by the appropriate scenario  weighting \\n(as opposed to weighting the inputs).  \\nAs with any economic forecasts, the projections and likelihoods of occurrence are subject to a high \\ndegree of inherent uncertainty and therefore the actual outcomes may be significantly different  to those \\nprojected. The Group considers these forecasts to represent its best estimate of the possible outcomes \\nand has analysed  the non -linearities and asymmetries within the Group’s different portfolios to establish \\nthat the chosen scenarios are appropr iately representative of the range of possible  scenarios.  \\nIAS1(125)  Economic variable assumptions  \\nThe most significant period -end assumptions used for the ECL estimate as at 31 December 2018 are set \\nout below.

More recent examples of such \\nevents include the UK “Brexit ” vote to leave the EU.  \\n Sensitivity analysis  \\nIAS1(129)  The most significant assumptions affecting the ECL allowance are as follows:  \\nRetail portfolios  \\n(i) House price index,  given the significant impact it has on mortgage collateral valuations; and  \\n(ii) Unemployment  rate, given its impact on secured and unsecured borrowers’ ability to meet their \\ncontractual repayments.  \\nWholesale portfolios  \\n(i) GDP,  given the significant impact on companie s’ perform ance and collateral valuations;  and \\n(ii) Interest  rate, given its impact on companies’ likelihood of default.  \\n Set out below are the changes to the ECL as at 31 December 2018 that would result from reasonably \\npossible  changes in these parameters from  the actual assumptions used in the Group’s economic \\nvariable assumptions (for example, the impact on ECL of increasing the estimat ed unemployment rate \\nby [X]% in each of the base, upside, downside, downside 2 and downside 3 scenarios):  \\n \\n  ', ' \\nIFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures   PwC \\uf0b7 37  \\n Retail portfo lios \\n   Unemployment  \\n  [-X%] \\nCU’000  No change  \\nCU’000  [+X%]  \\nCU’000  \\nHouse price index  [+X%]  X X X \\nNo change  X - X \\n[-X%] X X X \\n \\n Wholesale portfolios  \\n   Interest rates  \\n  [-X%] \\nCU’000  No change  \\nCU’000  [+X%]  \\nCU’000  \\nGDP  [+X%]  X X X \\nNo change  X - X \\n[-X%] X X X \\n \\n \\n PwC observation – Sensitivity analysis on ECL measurement  \\nThe key drivers of sensitivity disclosed above are purely illustrative and Banks will need to analyse  \\ntheir own portfolios to determine which parameter’s sensitivities are most r elevant to users of \\nthe financial  statements.   \\nIn particular, whilst not illustrated above, t his may include the sensitivity of the ECL provision to changes \\nin the weighting s determined for  each of the economic  scenarios.  \\nThe disclosure above represents on e way of meeting the disclosures required by IAS 1 paragraphs 125 \\nand 129. Banks should also consider, as applicable, the expectations and guidance provided by different \\nnational regulators and other international bodies, such as the Financial Stability Bo ard’s Enhanced \\nDisclosure Task Force (EDTF). Furthermore,  Banks should also consider the appropriate level of \\ngranularity for these disclosures, which may vary depending on the characteristics of their different \\nportfolios and which elements of the ECL cal culation have the greatest impact.  \\n  \\nIFRS7(35F)(c)  3.1.2.5 Grouping of instruments for losses measured on a collective basis  \\n For expected credit loss provisions modelled  on a collective basis, a grouping of exposures is performed \\non the basis of shared  risk characteristics, such that risk exposures within a group are  homogeneous.  \\nIn performing this grouping, there must be sufficient information for the group to be statistically credible. \\nWhere sufficient information is not available internally, the Grou p has considered benchmarking  \\ninternal/external supplementary data  to use for modelling  purposes.

The level at which ‘class’ is defined can vary across different disclosure requirements.  \\nTherefore, judgement  should be applied in determining the classes of financial  instrument to be disclosed, \\nwhich will often be on a more granular level than the balance sheet line items.  \\n \\nIFRS7(35N)  \\nIFRS7(B8J)  Disclosure not illustrated as not applicable to the Group  \\nWhen the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9 paragraph 5.5.15 is us ed to calculate the ECL of trade \\nreceivables, contract assets and lease receivable, the balances for such financial assets should be \\nseparately disclosed in an additional column in the table above.

Banks  should also consider whether \\nthere are other material causes of movement that should be shown separately. These might, for \\nexample, be shown in the analysis prepared internally for senior management. Additiona l rows may \\nalso be required to explain ECL movements for different types of products.  \\nWhere ECL allowance movements could potentially be reported in more than one row, explanation of \\nwhich changes are reported in which row will assist users of the financi al statements. Similarly, where ', ' \\nIFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures   PwC \\uf0b7 43 changing the order in which key drivers are changed could result in a significantly different allocation \\nbetween rows, explanation of the ordering used will be  useful.  \\nBanks should also consider disclosing whether ECL moveme nts from  transfers  between stages are \\nmeasured at the beginning or the end of the reporting periods.  \\n2 When applicable, separate  presentation (for example, in an additional column) is also required for \\ntrade receivables, contract assets or lease receivables for which loss allowances are measured in \\naccordance with paragraph 5.5.15 of IFRS 9 using the ‘simplified’ approach.  \\n3 The loss allowance for financial assets measured at fair value through OCI shall not be presented \\nseparately in the statement of financial  position as a reduction of the carrying amount of the financial \\nasset,  but should be disclosed in the notes.  \\n4 The reconciliation presented above splits items between those that impact P&L and those that do not. \\nThis is not an explicit requirement of IFRS 7  paragraph 35H, however  this information is likely to be \\nhelpful to users in understanding the impact of the various movements in ECL  allowance.  \\n \\nIFRS7(35I)  Significant changes in the gross carrying amount of financial assets that contributed to changes i n the loss \\nallowance were as follows:  \\n\\uf0b7 The high volume of new mortgages loans originat ed during the period, aligned with the Group’s \\norganic growth objective, increased the gross carrying amount of the mortgage book by 13%, with a \\ncorresponding CU 18 increa se in loss allowance measured on a 12 -month basis.  \\n\\uf0b7 The modification of mortgage contracts following renegotiation with customers facing financial \\ndifficulties resulted in a reduction of CU 61,000 in the gross carrying amount of Stage 3 mortgages. \\nThis also  resulted in the reversal of CU 36,000 of Stage 3 loss allowance. Also refer to note 3.1.6.  \\n\\uf0b7 The write -off of mortgage loans with a total gross carrying amount of CU 57,000 resulted in the \\nreduction of the Stage 3 loss allowance by the same amount.  \\nIFRS7(3 5I) The following table further explains changes in the gross carrying amount of the mortgage portfolio to help \\nexplain their significance to the changes in the loss allowance for the same portfolio as discussed above:  \\n  \\nStage 1  Stage 2  Stage 3  \\nPurchased \\ncredit -\\nimpaired  \\nTotal  Retail Mortgages  12-\\nmonth \\nECL Lifetime \\nECL Lifetime \\nECL \\n CU’000  CU’000  CU’000  CU’000  CU’000  \\nGross carrying amount as at  \\n1 January 2018  54,475  1,537  1,309  72 57,393  \\nTransfers:     \\n  \\nTransfer from Stage 1 to Stage 2  (1,345)  1,345 – – – \\nTransfer from Stage 1 to Stage 3  (120)  – 120 – – \\nTransfer from Stage 2 to Stage 3  – (166)  166 – – \\nTransfer from Stage 3 to Stage 2  – 3 (3) – – \\nTransfer from Stage 2 to Stage 1  33 (33) – – – \\nFinancial assets derecognised during the \\nperiod other  than write -offs (4,862)  (166)  (28) – (5,056)  \\nNew financial assets originated \\nor purchased  7,619  – – 6 7,625  \\nModification of contractual cash flows of \\nfinancial assets  – – (61) – (61) \\nChanges in interest accrual  2,233  64 33 – 2,330  \\nWrite -offs – – (57) – (57) \\nFX and other movements  109 7 – – 116 \\nGross carrying amount as at \\n31 December 2018  58,142  2,591  1,479  78 62,290  \\n[The disclosures above should be repeated for each class of financial instrument, but are omitted here \\nfor illustrative purposes].  \\n ', ' \\nIFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures   PwC \\uf0b7 44  PwC observation – Reconciliation of gross carrying amount  \\nIFRS 7 paragraph 35I does not explicitly require  the gross carrying amount of financial instruments to be \\nreconciled. However, a reconciliation table, in addition to narrative disclosures, is includ ed in IFRS 7 \\nparagraph IG20B as an illustration of how the information required by that paragraph can be provided. In \\nour view, including such a reconciliation table will typically be the most helpful way of meeting these \\ndisclosure requirements.  \\nMovement descriptions in this table may need to be amended based on product types (e.g. a specific line \\nfor ‘additional drawings’ on existing drawn facilities).  \\nIf included, this table should also be provided for each class of financial instrument.  \\n \\nIFRS7(35H)(c)  The total amount of undiscounted expected credit losses at initial recognition for purchased or originated \\ncredit -impaired financial assets recognised  during the period was CU 10,000.  \\n 3.1.5  Write -off policy  \\nIFRS7(35F)(e)  The Group writes off financial a ssets, in whole or in part, when it has exhausted all practical recovery \\nefforts and has concluded there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that there is no \\nreasonable expectation of recovery include (i) ceasing enforcement activity and (ii) where the Group’s \\nrecovery method is foreclosing on collateral and the value of the collateral is such that there is no \\nreasonable expectation of recovering in full.  \\nIFRS7(35F)(e)  \\nIFRS7(35L)  The Group may write -off financial assets that are still subj ect to enforcement activity.  The outstanding \\ncontractual amounts of such assets written off during the year ended 31 December 2018 was CU 41,000.  \\nThe Group still seeks to recover amounts it is legally owed in full, but which have been partially written off  \\ndue to no reasonable expectation of full recovery.  \\n 3.1.6  Modification of financial assets  \\n The Group sometimes modifies the terms of loans provided to customers due to commercial \\nrenegotiations, or for distressed loans, with a view to maximising recove ry. \\n Such restructuring activities include extended payment term arrangements, payment holidays and \\npayment forgiveness. Restructuring policies and practices are based on indicators or criteria which, in the \\njudgement of management, indicate that payment will most likely continue. These policies are kept under \\ncontinuous review. Restructuring is most commonly applied to term loans.  \\nIFRS7(35F)(f)(i)  \\nIFRS7(35J)(b)  The risk of default of such assets after modification is assessed at the reporting date and co mpared with \\nthe risk under the original terms at initial recognition, when the modification is not substantial and so does \\nnot result in derecognition of the original asset (refer to notes 1.2.1.1(iv) and (v) above). The Group \\nmonitors the subsequent perfo rmance of modified assets. The Group may determine that the credit risk \\nhas significantly improved after restructuring, so that the assets are moved from Stage 3 or Stage 2 \\n(Lifetime ECL) to Stage 1 (12 -month ECL). This is only the case for assets which ha ve performed in \\naccordance with the new terms for six consecutive months or more . The gross carrying amount of such \\nassets held as at 31 December 2018 was CU  41,000. \\nIFRS7(35F)(f)(ii)  The Group continues to monitor if there is a subsequent significant in crease in credit risk in relation to \\nsuch assets through the use of specific models for modified assets.  \\nIFRS7(35J)(a)  The following table includes summary information for financial assets with lifetime ECL whose cash flows \\nwere modified during the period  as part of the Group’s restructuring activities and their respective effect on \\nthe Group’s financial performance:  \\n   \\nLoans and advance to customers  \\n  CU’000   \\nAmortised  cost before modification  234  \\nNet modification (loss)  (61) \\n ', ' \\nIFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures   PwC \\uf0b7 45  PwC observation – Voluntary disclosure of net impact in P&L from modifications  \\nThe overall profit or loss impact of modifications will often be less than the net gain/(loss) disclosed above, \\nwhich excludes the impact of any offsetting release of ECL allowances. W hile not required by IFRS 7, \\nBanks may, therefore,  wish to explain this, with disclosure such as:  \\n‘The net modification loss above represents the changes in the gross carrying amounts (i.e. before \\nimpairment allowance) of the financial assets from immediat ely before, to immediately after, modification. \\nIn the significant majority of cases, this gross loss had been anticipated and already materially reflected \\nwithin the ECL allowance. The impact of modification on the ECL allowances associated with these ass ets \\nwas a release of ECL allowances of CU[X]. The net impact on the statement of profit or loss for the period \\nwas, therefore,  CU[X].’  \\n \\n4. Hedge accounting disclosures  \\n The Group applies hedge accounting in three separate hedging strategies, as follows:  \\n Interest rate risk on fixed rate mortgages (fair value hedge)  \\nIFRS7(22A)(a),  \\n(22B)(a)  The Group holds a portfolio of long-term fixed rate mortgages and therefore is exposed to changes in fair \\nvalue due to movements in market interest rates. The Group man ages this risk exposure by entering into \\npay fixed /receive  floating interest rate swaps.  \\nIFRS7( 22A)(b),  \\n(22B)(b), (22C)  Only the interest rate risk element is hedged and therefore other risks, such as credit risk, are managed \\nbut not hedged by the Group.  The interest rate risk component is determined as the change in fair value of \\nthe long -term fixed rate mortgages arising solely from changes in 3 -month LIBOR (the benchmark rate of \\ninterest).  Such changes are usually the largest component of the overall c hange in fair value. This strategy \\nis designated as a fair value hedge and its effectiveness is assessed by comparing changes in the fair \\nvalue of the loans attributable to changes in the benchmark rate of interest with changes in the fair value \\nof the int erest rate swaps.  \\nIFRS7 (22B)(c),  \\n(23D)  The Group establishes the hedging ratio by matching the notional  of the derivatives with the principal of \\nthe portfolio being hedged. Possible sources of ineffectiveness are as follows:  \\n(i) differences between the expect ed and actual volume of prepayments, as the Group hedges to the \\nexpected repayment date taking into account expected prepayments based on past  experience;  \\n(ii) difference in the discounting between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, as cash \\ncollaterali sed interest rate swaps are discounted using Overnight Indexed Swaps (OIS) discount \\ncurves, which are not applied to the fixed rate mortgages;  \\n(iii) hedging derivatives with a non -zero fair value at the date of initial designation as a hedging \\ninstrument; and  \\n(iv) counterparty credit risk which impacts the fair value of uncollateralised interest rate swaps but not the \\nhedged items.  \\nIFRS7( 23C)  The Group manages the interest rate risk arising from fixed rate mortgages by entering into interest rate \\nswaps on a monthly b asis. The exposure from this portfolio frequently changes due to new loans \\noriginated, contractual repayments and early prepayments made by customers in each period. As a result, \\nthe Group adopts a dynamic hedging strategy (sometimes referred to as a ‘macr o’ or ‘portfolio’ hedge) to \\nhedge the exposure profile by closing and entering into new swap agreements at each month -end. The \\nGroup uses the portfolio fair value hedge of interest rate risk to recognise  fair value changes related to \\nchanges in interest ra te risk in the mortgage portfolio, and therefore reduce the profit or loss volatility that \\nwould otherwise arise from changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps alone.  ', ' \\nIFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures   PwC \\uf0b7 46 IFRS7(24D)  Disclosures not illustrated as not applicable to the Group  \\nParagraph 2 3C of IFRS 7 exempts entities from disclosing the profile of the timing of the nominal amounts \\nand the average price or rate of the hedging instruments for ‘macro’ hedges – as in such hedges entities \\nfrequently reset the hedging relationship – and instead requires the disclosure of information included in \\nthe illustrative disclosure above. When the volume of such hedging relationships is unrepresentative of \\nnormal volumes during the period (i.e. the volume at the reporting date does not reflect the volumes during \\nthe period) , an entity shall disclose that fact and the reason it believes the volumes are unrepresentative.  \\n \\n Foreign exchange risk on foreign currency debt (cash flow hedge)  \\nIFRS7( 22A)(a),  \\n(22A)(b),  \\n(22A)(c),  \\n(22B)(a),  (22C)  The Group accesses i nternational markets in order to obtain effective sources of funding. As part of this \\nprocess, the Group assumes significant foreign currency exposure, principally USD. The foreign currency \\nrisk component is then managed and mitigated by the use of cross c urrency swaps, which exchange fixed \\ninterest payments in the foreign currency for fixed interest payments in CU. These instruments are entered \\ninto to match the maturity profile of estimated repayments of the Group’s debt instruments. This hedging \\nstrategy  is applied to the portion of the exposure that is not naturally offset against matching asset \\npositions held by the Group in financial investments also denominated in foreign currencies.  The foreign \\ncurrency risk component is determined as the change in c ash flows of the foreign currency debt arising \\nsolely from changes in the relevant foreign currency forward exchange rate. Such changes constitute a \\nsignificant component of the overall changes in cash flows of the instrument.  \\nIFRS7 22B(b)  The effectivene ss of this strategy is assessed by comparing the changes in fair value of the cross \\ncurrency  swap with changes in fair value of the hedged debt attributable to the hedged risk ( changes \\nin foreign currency  forward exchange rates ), using the hypothetical der ivative method.  \\nIFRS7( 22B)(c),  \\n(23D)  The Group establishes the hedging ratio by matching the notional  of the derivative with the principal of the \\nspecific debt instrument being hedged (sometimes referred to as a ‘micro’ hedge). Possible sources of \\nineffec tiveness are as follows:  \\n(i) Differences in timing of cash flows between debt instruments and cross currency swaps;  \\n(ii) Differences in the discounting between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, as cash \\ncollateralised cross currency swaps are discounted us ing Overnight Indexed Swaps (OIS) discount \\ncurves, which are not applied to the foreign debt;  \\n(iii) Hedging derivatives with a non -zero fair value at the date of initial designation as a hedging \\ninstrument; and  \\n(iv) Counterparty credit risk which impacts the fair val ue of uncollateralised cross currency swaps but not \\nthe hedged items.  \\n \\nIFRS7( 23F) Disclosures not illustrated as not applicable to the Group  \\nFor cash flow hedges, an entity shall also disclose a description of any forecast transaction for which \\nhedge acco unting had been used in the previous period, but which is no longer expected to  occur.  \\n \\n Net investment in foreign operation (net investment hedge)  \\nIFRS7( 22A)(a),  \\n(22A)(b),  \\n(22A)(c),  \\n(22B)(a),  \\n(22B)(b)  The Group has an investment in a foreign operation w hich is consolidated in its financial statements and \\nwhose functional currency is US Dollars. The foreign exchange rate exposure arising from this investment \\nis hedged through the use of two year FX forward contracts. These contracts are entered into to he dge \\n90% of the exposure arising from the net assets held in the foreign operation and are rolled forward on a \\nperiodic basis.  \\n The Group only designates the undiscounted spot element of the FX forwards as hedging instruments. \\nChanges in the fair value of the hedging instruments attributable to changes in forward  points and the \\neffect of discounting are recognised  directly in profit or loss within the “Net trading income ” line – These \\namounts are, therefore, not included in the hedge effectiveness assessmen t.  \\nIFRS7( 22B)(c),  \\n(23D),  (22C)  The Group establishes the hedging ratio by matching the notional  of the forward contracts with 90% of the \\nnet assets of the foreign operation. Given that only the undiscounted spot element of the FX forwards is \\ndesignated i n the hedging relationship, no ineffectiveness is expected unless the foreign operation’s ', ' \\nIFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures   PwC \\uf0b7 47 losses exceed 10% of net assets during the reporting period. The foreign currency risk component is \\ndetermined as the change in the carrying amount of net assets of t he foreign operation arising solely from \\nchanges in spot foreign currency exchange rates.  \\nIFRS7( 23E)  Disclosures not illustrated as not applicable to the Group  \\nIf other sources of hedge ineffectiveness emerge in a hedging relationship, an entity shall dis close those \\nsources by risk category and explain the resulting hedge ineffectiveness.  \\n \\nIFRS7( 23B)  The following table sets out the maturity profile and average price/rate of the hedging instruments used in \\nthe Group’s non -dynamic hedging strategies:  \\n  \\nMaturity  \\n \\nUp to one \\nmonth  One to \\nthree \\nmonths  Three \\nmonths to \\none year  One year \\nto five \\nyears  More than \\nfive years  \\n CU’000  CU’000  CU’000  CU’000  CU’000  \\nCash flow hedges            \\nForeign exchange       \\nCross currency interest rate swap       \\nNotional  120 234 443 2,312  652 \\nAverage fixed interest rate  5.30%  5.31%  6.34%  9.25%  9.56%  \\nAverage CU/USD exchange rate  1.23 1.27 1.43 1.51 2.01 \\nNet investment hedge            \\nForeign exchange       \\nFX forward       \\nNotional  – – – 587 – \\nAverage CU/USD exchange rate  – – – 1.47 – \\n \\n PwC observation – Hedges of multiple risk categories  \\nHedging disclosures are generally required to be provided by risk category.

Other disclosures  \\n \\nPwC observation – Additional new disclosures introduced by IFRS 9  \\nThis note highlights additional new d isclosures required by IFRS 9 that Banks should consider  when \\npreparing their financial statements under IFRS 9.  \\n \\n5.1 Financial liabilities designated at FVPL  \\n The Group issued a 15 -year note in 2015 with an annual fixed coupon of 4% and which contained a  call \\noption that is not closely related to the host contract. The Group designated the entire hybrid contract as a \\nfinancial liability at fair value through profit or loss.  \\nIFRS7  (10)(b)  The contractual undiscounted amount that will be required to be pai d at maturity of the above structured  \\nnote is CU 951,000 greater than its carrying amount of CU 1,791,000.  \\n At 31 December 2018, the cumulative own credit adjustment gain amounted to CU 83,000. The cumulative \\ngain is recognised  within ‘Other Reserves’ in Equity.  \\n \\n Disclosures not illustrated as not applicable to the Group  \\nThe disclosures requirements in relation to financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss \\nhave not changed significantly under IFRS 9. However, the following additional  disclosures, which were \\nnot applicable to the Group, need to be presented when applicable:  \\nIFRS7 (10)(c),  \\n(10)(d)  (i) For financial liabilities designated at fair value for which changes in the liability’s credit risk are \\nrecognised OCI, in addition to disclosure of the cumulative changes in fair value attributable to \\nchanges in credit risk of that financial liability and the difference between its carrying amount and the \\namount contractually required to be paid at maturity (which are also required for f inancial liabilities \\nwith all changes presented in profit or loss), disclosure should also be given of transfers of the \\ncumulative gain or loss within equity during the period and the reason for these transfer, and the \\namount (if any) presented in OCI that  was realised on derecognition of f inancial liabilities during \\nthe period.  \\nIFRS7 (11)(c)  (ii) A detailed description of the methodology used to determine whether presenting effects of changes in \\na liability’s credit risk in OCI would create or enlarge an accou nting mismatch. If an entity is required \\nby paragraph 5.7.8 of IFRS 9 to present the effects of changes in a liability’s credit risk in profit or loss \\nfor this reason, the disclosure must include a detailed description of the economic relationship \\nbetween the characteristics of the liability and the characteristics of the other financial instruments \\nwhose change in fair value is expected to be offset within  profit or  loss. \\n \\n5.2 Investments in equity instruments designated at FVOCI  \\nIFRS7 (11A)(a),  \\n(b) The Gr oup has designated at FVOCI investments in a small portfolio of equity securities issued by the \\nfollowing clearing houses and exchanges:  \\n\\uf0b7 Clearing House A;  \\n\\uf0b7 Clearing House B;  \\n\\uf0b7 Exchange C; and \\n\\uf0b7 Exchange D.  \\nThe Group chose this presentation alternative  because  the investments were made for strategic purposes \\nrather than with a view to profit on a subsequent sale, and there are no plans to dispose of these \\ninvestments in the short or medium term.  \\nIFRS7 (11A)(c),  \\n(d),(e)  The fair value of these investments is CU 753,000 as at 31 December 2018. There was no dividend \\nrecognised  during the period nor transfers of the cumulative gain within equity.

Such reclassifications under IFRS 9 are expected to be rare in \\npractice and therefo re have not been illustrated in this document. The following are the disclosures that \\nshould be presented when applicable:  \\nIFRS7 (12B)  For each such reclassification, in the current or previous reporting periods, the following should \\nbe disclosed:  \\n(a) The date of reclassification;  \\n(b) A detailed explanation of the change in business model and a qualitative description of its effect on \\nthe Bank’s financial statements; and  \\n(c) The amount reclassified into and out of each category.  \\nIFRS7 (12C)  For each reporting period fo llowing a reclassification from FVPL to amortised  cost or FVOCI, until \\nderecognition, the Bank should disclose:  \\n(a) The effective interest rate determined on the date of reclassification; and  \\n(b) The interest revenue recognised.  \\nIFRS7 (12D)  If, since its last annu al reporting date, a Bank has reclassified a financial asset (i) from FVOCI to amortised  \\ncost, or (ii) from FVPL to amortised  cost or FVOCI, it shall disclose:  \\n(a) The fair value of the financial asset at the end of the period ; and \\n(b) The fair value gain or loss that would have been recognised in profit or loss or OCI during the \\nreporting period if the financial assets had not been reclassified.  \\n \\n5.4 Net gains/(losses) on derecognition of financial assets measured at amortised  cost \\nIFRS7  (20A)  During the period,  the Group sold a portfolio of loans to customers due to a credit risk management \\ndecision to eliminate the exposure following a deterioration in credit risk .

       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 1 This publication presents illustrative disclosures introduced or modified by IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’ for a fictional medium -sized bank. We have illustrated a realistic set of disclosures for a medium -sized bank. However, as this publication is a reference tool, we have not removed any disclosures based on materiality. Con sequently, some of the disclosures in this publication would likely be immaterial if the bank were a ‘real life’ company. IFRS 9 allows a variety of approaches in measuring expected credit losses (ECL) and industry thinking continues to evolve at the date of this publication . Banks will need to take account of their individual circumstances in determining the approach taken to measuring ECL and the appropriate disclosures . The approaches illustrated in this publication are one possible way the requirement s of IFRS 9 ECL may be met but are not intended to provide any view on the type of approach that should be applied . Using this publication The source for each disclosure requirement is given in the reference column. There is also commentary that (i) explains some of the most challenging areas, or (ii) lists disclosures that have not been included because they are not relevant to the fictional bank’s circumstances. The example disclosures may not be the only acceptable form of presenting financial statement di sclosures. Alternative presentations may be acceptable if they comply with the specific disclosure requirements prescribed by IFRS. Readers may find our IFRS disclosure checklist useful to identify other disclosures that may be relevant under the circumsta nces but are not illustrated in this publication (such as those highlighted in observations boxes throughout this publication). Conversely, disclosures prese nted in this publication should not be included where they are not relevant or not material in spec ific circumstances. Preparers of financial reporting should also consider local legal and regulatory requirements which may stipulate additional disclosures that are not illustrated in this publication. Specific ally, this publication does not cover the dis closure recommendations proposed by the Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF) in its ‘Impact of Expected Credit Loss Approaches on Bank Risk Disclosures ’ report. Finally, we note that, when banks provide some of the disclosures required by IFRS in section s of their Annual Reports other than the financial statements, these too need to be updated for changes introduced by IFRS 9.

We also note that Banks choosing not to restate the comparative period, th at previously used IAS 39 terms such as ‘Available for sale’ in line item description s, will need to show th e retired IAS 39 categories for comparatives. Gains and losses on derecog nition of financial assets measured at amortised cost are now required to be presented separately on the face of the statement of profit or loss.

       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 9 Notes to the financial statements 1. Significant accounting policies 1.1 Changes in accounting policies IFRS9 (7.2.15) The Group has adopte d IFRS 9 as issued by the IASB in July 2014 with a date of transition of 1 January 2018, which resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts previously recognised in the financial statements. The Group did not early adopt any o f IFRS 9 in previous periods. As permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the Group elected not to restate comparative figures. Any adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were recognised in the opening retained earnings and other reserves of the current period. The Group has also elected to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 on adoption of IFRS 9. Consequently, for notes disclosures, the consequential amendments to IFRS 7 disclosures have also only been applied to the current period. The comparative period notes disclosures repeat those disclosures made in the prior year. The adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in changes in our accounting policies for recognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and impairment of financial assets. IFRS 9 also significantly amends other standards dealing with financial instruments such as IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures ’. Set out below are disclosures relating to the impact of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the Group. Further details of the specific IFRS 9 accounting policies applied in the current period (as well as the previous IAS 39 accounting policies applied in the comparativ e period) are described in more detail in section 1.2 below. (a) Classification and measurement of financial instruments IFRS7 (42I)(a),(b) The measurement category and the carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities in accordance with IAS 39 an d IFRS 9 at 1 January 2018 are compared as follows: IAS 39 IFRS 9 Measurement category Carrying amount Measurement category Carrying amount Financial assets CU’000 CU’000 Cash and balances with central banks Amortised cost (Loans and receivables) 4,343 Amortised cost 4,343 Loans and advances to banks Amortised cost (Loans and receivables) 8,050 Amortised cost 7,992 Loans and advances to customers Amortised cost (Loans and receivables) 76,520 Amortised cost 68,992 FVPL (Mandatory) 6,617 Trading assets FVPL (Held for trading) 10,880 FVPL (Mandatory) 10,880 Hedging derivatives FVPL (Hedging instrument) (a) 1,654 FVPL (Mandatory) (a) 1,654 Investment securities FVOCI (Available for sale) 2,678 FVOCI 1,228 Amortised cost (Loans and Receivab les) 546 Amortised cost 2,209 Amortised cost (Held to Maturity) 1,205 FVPL (Designated) 546 FVPL (Designated) – FVPL (Embedded derivative) 12 FVPL (Mandatory) 1,536',\n",

Any ineffectiveness is recognised in profit or loss. There were no changes to the classificati on and measurement of financial liabilities, other than to changes in the fair value of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss that are attributable to changes in the instrument’s credit risk, which are now presented in other comprehensive income (refer to note 1.2.1.2(i)). PwC observation – Classification of cash and deposits with banks The classification of cash deposits is determined based on the same requirements as other financial assets. Therefore, an assessment of bus iness model and SPPI criterion should be performed based on the specific facts and circumstances. However, in most situations, the business model would be expected to be Hold to Collect (e.g. the business model would not involve selling cash balances to ot her parties) and the SPPI test would be met (e.g. as only a benchmark rate, or nil, interest is earned). (b) Reconciliation of statement of financial position balances from IAS 39 to IFRS 9 IFRS7(42J) The Group performed a detailed analysis of its busi ness models for managing financial assets and analysis of their cash flow characteristics.

Any ineffectiveness is recognised in profit or loss. The total remeasurement loss of CU 983,000 was recog nised in opening reserves at 1 January 2018. In addition, an amount of CU 120 ,000 was reclassified from retai ned earnings to other reserves at 1 January 2018 in respect of cumulative own credit a djustment s on fina ncial liabilities designated at fair value through profit and loss. The following explains how applying the new classification requirements of IFRS 9 led to changes in classification of certain financial assets held by the Group as shown in the table above: (A) Debt instruments previously classified as available fo r sale but which fail the SPPI test The Group holds a portfolio of debt instruments that failed to meet the ‘solely payments of principal and interest’ (SPPI) requirement for amortised cost classification under IFRS 9. These instruments contain provision s that, in certain circumstances, can allow the issuer to defer interest payments, but which do not accrue additional interest. This clause breaches the criterion that interest payments should only be consideration for credit risk and the time value of mon ey on the principal. As a result, these instruments, which amounted to CU 455,000, were classified as FVPL from the date of initial application. (B) Securities within the liquidity portfolio After assessing its business model for securities within t he Group’s liquidity portfolio, which are mostly held to collect the contractual cash flows and sell, the Group has identified certain securities which are managed separately and for which the past practice has been (and the Group’s intention remains) to h old to collect the contractual cash flows. Consequently, the Group assessed that the appropriate business model for this group of securities is held to collect. These securities, which amounted to CU 341,000 and which were previously classified as availabl e for sale, were classified as amortised cost from the date of initial application. The remainder of the Group’s liquidity portfolio is held to collect contractual cash flows and sell.',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 14 (C) Syndicated loans The Group acted as the lead arranger of a synd icated loan facility to one of its major customers. The facility amount requested by the customer exceeded the Group’s limit for single client exposure under the Group credit risk policy, so the facility was approved with the condition that the excess amou nt of CU 6,541,000 be sold in the medium term. Under IFRS 9, this amount exceeding the Group’s limit is classified as part of a hold to sell business model and measured at FVPL. The loan was previously measured at amortised cost in its entirety. (D) Investments in convertible loan notes The Group holds investments in convertible loan notes of CU 102,000 which are not traded in an active market. These were accounted for previously as hybrid instruments with (i) the equity conversion feature representi ng an embedded derivative separately accounted for at fair value through profit or loss (presented together with Investment Securities) and (ii) the debt host classified as a loan and receivable and measured at amortised cost. Under IFRS 9, the instruments are assessed as a whole and, due to the equity conversion feature, failed the SPPI test. Consequently, the instruments are now measured at FVPL in their entirety. (E) Investments in asset -backed securities The Group holds investments in a portfolio of fixed rate securities backed by real estate property loans which were issued by a special purpose entity. After performing detailed analysis, the Group concluded that these investments do not pass the SPPI test given the notes form part of one of the m ore subordinated tranches issued by the special purpose entity, so that the exposure to credit risk of the investment is greater than the exposure to credit risk of the underlying asset pool as a whole. As a result, this portfolio of securities, which were previously classified as available -for-sale and amounted to CU 654,000, have been reclassified to FVPL. (F) Investment in debt securities previously designated at fair value through profit or loss IFRS7(42I)(c) IFRS7(42J)(b) The Group holds an inves tment of CU 310,000 in a portfolio of debt securities which had previously been designated at fair value through profit or loss as the debt securities were managed on a fair value basis. As part of the transition to IFRS 9, these securities are part of an ‘other’ business model and so required to be classified as FVPL, instead of designated FVPL. (G) De -designation of investment in debt instrument previously designated at fair value through profit or loss IFRS7(42I)(c) IFRS7(42J)(b) The Group holds de bt instruments amounting to CU 236,000 equivalent which had previously been designated at FVPL to reduce an accounting mismatch with derivatives used in an economic hedge of interest rate risk. The Group has chosen to de -designate these financial assets up on transition to IFRS 9 and measure them at amortised cost as, subsequent to initial recognition, the Group has economically offset the original exposure with debt securities and, consequently, terminated the derivatives previously used in the economic hed ge. IFRS7(42N) The effective interest rate of these debt instruments is 8.5% per annum and CU 20,000 of interest income has been recognised during the year. IFRS7(42N) PwC observation – Disclosures of EIR and interest income for financial assets and liab ilities reclassified out of FVPL category on transition to IFRS 9 If an entity treats the fair value of a financial asset or a financial liability as the new gross carrying amount at the date of initial application (when allowed by paragraph 7.2.11 of IFRS 9), the disclosure above shall be made for each reporting period until derecognition. If an entity does not, these disclosures need not be made after the annual reporting period in which the entity initially applies the classification and measurement requ irements for financial assets in IFRS 9.',\n",

In particular, the IAS 39 accounting policies applied in the prior period and IFRS 13 policies relating to the measurement of fair value in both periods are not repeated here, but will need to be presented. This note sets out the significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidat ed financial statements. 1.2.1 Financial assets and liabilities Measurement methods Amortised cost and effective interest rate IFRS9(App A) The amortised cost is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any loss allowance. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset (i.e. its amortised cost before any impairment allowance) or to the amortised cost of a financial liability. The calculation does not consider expected credit losses and includes transaction costs, premiums or discounts and fees and points paid or received that are integral to the effec tive interest rate, such as origination fees. For purchased or originated credit -impaired (‘POCI’) financial assets – assets that are credit -impaired (see definition on note 3.1.2.2) at initial recognition – the Group calculates the credit -adjusted effecti ve interest rate, which is calculated based on the amortised cost of the financial assetinstead of its gross carrying amount and incorporates the impact of expected credit losses in estimated future cash flows. When the Group revises the estimates of fut ure cash flows, the carrying amount of the respective financial assets or financial liability is adjusted to reflect the new estimate discounted using the original effective interest rate. Any chan ges are recognised in profit or loss. Interest income IFRS9(5.4.1) Interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of financial assets , except for: (a) POCI financial assets, for which the original credit -adjusted effective interest rate is applied to the amortised cost of the financial asset. (b) Financial assets that are not ‘POCI’ but have subsequently become credit -impaired (or ‘stage 3’), for which interest revenue is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to their amortised cost (i.e. net of the expect ed credit loss provision). Initial recognition and measurement IFRS9(3.1.1) IFRS9(3.1.2) Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade -date, the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 18 IFRS9(5.1.1) At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset or financial liability at its fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset or financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are incremental and directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability, such as fees and co mmissions. Transaction costs of financial assets and financial liabilities carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss. Immediately after initial recognition, an expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for financi al assets measured at amortised cost and investments in debt instruments measured at FVOCI, as described in note 3.1.2, which results in an accounting loss being recognised in profit or loss when an asset is newly originated. IFRS 9 (B5.1.2A) When the fai r value of financial assets and liabilities differs from the transaction price on initial recognition, the entity recogn ises the difference as follows: (a) When the fair value is evidenced by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liabili ty (i.e. a Level 1 input) or based on a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, the difference is recognised as a gain or loss. (b) In all other cases, the difference is deferred and the timing of recognition of deferred day one profit or loss is determined individually. It is either amortised over the life of the instrument, deferred until the instrument’s fair value can be determined using market observable inputs, or realised through settlement. 1.2.1.1 Financial assets (i) Class ification and subsequent measurement IFRS9(4.1.1) From 1 January 2018, the Group has applied IFRS 9 and classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories: Fair value through profit or loss (FVPL); Fair value through other comprehensi ve income (FVOCI); or Amortised cost. The classification requirements for debt and equity instruments are described below: Debt instruments Debt instruments are those instruments that meet the definition of a financial liability from the issuer’s perspective, such as loans, government and corporate bonds and trade receivables purchased from clients in factoring arrangements without recourse. IFRS9(5.1.1) Classification and subsequent measurement of debt instruments depend on: (i) the Group’s business mo del for managing the asset ; and (ii) the cash flow characteristics of the asset. Based on these factors, the Group classifies its debt instruments into one of the following three measurement categories: IFRS9(4.1.2) Amortised cost: Assets that are held for co llection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest (‘SPPI’), and that are not designated at FVPL, are measured at amortised cost. The carrying amount of these assets is adjusted by any expected cre dit loss allowance recognised and measured as described in note 3.1.2. Interest income from these financial assets is included in ‘Interest and similar income’ using the effective interest rate method. IFRS9(4.1.2A) Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI): Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the assets, where the assets’ cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, and that are not designated at FVPL, are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). Movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses on the instrument’s amortised cost wh ich are recognised in profit or loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognised in ‘Net Investment income’. Interest income from these financial assets is included in ‘Interest income’ using the effective interest rate method.',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 19 IFRS9(4.1.4) Fair value through profit or loss: Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at fair value through profit or loss. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss and presented in the profit or loss statement within ‘Net trading income’ in th e period in which it arises, unless it arises from debt instruments that were designated at fair value or which are not held for trading, in which case they are presented separately in ‘Net investment income’. Interest income from these financial assets is included in ‘Interest income’ us ing the effective interest rate method. IFRS9 (B4.1.2.A) , (B4.1.2.B) Business model: the business model reflects how the Group manages the assets in order to generate cash flows. That is, whether the Group’s objective is solely to collect the contractual cash flows from the assets or is to collect both the contractual cash flows and cash flows arising from the sale of assets. If neither of these is applicable (e.g. financial assets are held for trading purposes), then the f inancial assets are classified as part of ‘other’ business model and measured at FVPL. Factors considered by the Group in determining the business model for a group of assets include past experience on how the cash flows for these assets were collected, how the asset’s performance is evaluated and reported to key management personnel, how risks are assessed and managed and how managers are compensated. For example, the Group’s business model for the mortgage loan book is to hold to collect contractual cash flows, with sales of loans only being made internally to a consolidated SPV for the purposes of collateralising notes issued, with no resulting derecognition by the Group. Another example is the liquidity portfolio of assets, which is held by the Group as part of liquidity management and is generally classified within the hold to collect and sell business model. Securities held for trading are held principally for the purpose of selling in the near term or are part of a portfolio of financial instruments th at are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short -term profit -taking. These securities are classified in the ‘other’ business model and measured at FVPL. IFRS9 (B4.1.7A) SPPI: Where the business model is to hold a ssets to collect contractual cash flows or to collect contractual cash flows and sell, the Group assesses whether the financial instruments’ cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest (the ‘SPPI test’). In making this assessment, the Gr oup considers whether the contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic lending arrangement i.e. interest includes only consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks and a profit margin that is consistent with a bas ic lending arrangement. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that are inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss. PwC observat ion – Significant accounting judgements in determining business model and applying SPPI test Determining the appropriate business model and assessing whether cash flows generated by an asset constitute solely payments of principal and interest is sometimes complex and may require significant judgement. Depending on the level of judgement and the amount of financial assets affected by the conclusion, the SPPI and/or business model assessment may require disclosure as a significant judgement in accordance wit h paragraph 122 of IAS 1. For example, a judgement on whether or not a contractual clause in all loans of a certain type (e.g. all residential mortgages) breaches SPPI and results in a material portfolio being recorded at FVPL. IFRS9(4.3.2), (4.3.3) Finan cial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest. IFRS9(4.4.1) The Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for m anaging those assets changes. The reclassification takes place from the start of the first reporting period following the change. Such changes are expected to be very infrequent and none occurred during the period.',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 20 IFRS9(4.1.5) Disclosures not illustra ted as not applicable to the Group The following is a possible accounting policy for fair value option for financial assets, which was not included as not used by the Group: Fair value option for financial assets The Group may also irrevocably design ate financial assets at fair value through profit or loss if doing so significantly reduces or eliminates a mismatch created by assets and liabilities being measured on different bases . Equity instruments IAS32R(11) Equity instruments are instruments that meet the definition of equity from the issuer’s perspective ; that is, instruments that do not contain a contractual obligation to pay and that evidence a residual interest in the issuer’s net assets. Examples of equity instruments include basic ordina ry shares. IFRS9(5.7.2) The Group subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value through profit or loss, except where the Group’s management has elected, at initial recognition, to irrevocably designate an equity investment at fair value throu gh other comprehensive income. The Group’s policy is to designate equity investments as FVOCI when those investments are held for purposes other than to generate investment returns. When this election is used , fair value gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss, including on disposal. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) are not reported separately from other changes in fair value. Dividends, when representing a return on such investment s, continue to be recognised in profit or loss as other income when the Group’s right to receive payments is established. Gains and losses on equity investments at FVPL are included in the ‘Net trading income’ line in the statement of profit or loss. (ii) Impairment IFRS9(5.5.17) The Group assesses on a forward -looking basis the expected credit losses (‘ECL’) associated with its debt instrument assets carried at amortised cost and FVOCI and with the exposure arising from loan commitments and financial gu arantee contracts. The Group recognises a loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects: An unbiased and probability -weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes; The time value of m oney; and Reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. Note 3.1.2 provides more detail of how the expected cre dit loss allowance is measured. (iii) Modification of loans IFRS9(5.4.3) The Group sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of loans to customers. When this happens, the Group assesses whether or not the new terms are substantially different to the original terms. The Group does this by considering, among others, the following factors: If the borrower is in financial difficulty, whether the modification merely reduces the contractual cash flows to amounts the borrower is e xpected to be able to pay. Whether any substantial new terms are introduced, such as a profit share /equity -based return that substantially affects the risk profile of the loan. Significant extension of the loan term when the borrower is not in financial di fficulty. Significant change in the interest rate. Change in the currency the loan is denominated in. Insertion of collateral, other security or credit enhancements that significantly affect the credit risk associated with the loan.',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 21 IFRS9(B5.5.25 ), (B5.5. 26) If the terms are substantially different, the Group derecognises the original financial asset and recognises a ‘new’ asset at fair value and recalculates a new effective interest rate for the asset. The date of renegotiation is consequently considered to be the date of initial recognition for impairment calculation purposes, including for the purpose of determining whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred. However, the Group also assesses whether the new financial asset recognised is deemed to be credit -impaired at initial recognition, especially in circumstances where the renegotiation was driven by the debtor being unable to make the originally agreed payments. Differences in the carrying amount are also recognised in profit or loss as a gain or loss on derecognition. IFRS9(5.4.3) If the terms are not substantially different, the renegotiation or modification does not result in derecognition, and the Group recalculates the gross carrying amount based on the revised cash flows of the financial asset and recognises a modification gain or loss in profit or loss. The new gross carrying amount is recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original effective interest rate (or credit -adjusted effective interest rate for purch ased or originated credit -impaired financial assets). The impact of modifications of financial assets on the expected credit loss c alculation is discussed in note 3.1.5. PwC observation – Derecognition of revolving products The derecognition assessment for revolving products, such as credit cards and overdrafts, is a complex area which requires significant judgement in applying the IFRS 9 requirements. Therefore, additional disclosures would be expected about the accounting policies applied to such prod ucts where these are relevant to the entity. (iv) Derecognition other than on a modification IFRS9(3.2.3) Financial assets, or a portion thereof, are derecognised when the contractual rights to receive the cash flows from the assets have expired, or whe n they have been transferred and either (i) the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, or (ii) the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and the Group has not retained contro l. IFRS9(3.2.5) The Group enters into transactions where it retains the contractual rights to receive cash flows from assets but assumes a contractual obligation to pay those cash flows to other entities and transfers substantially all of the risks and re wards. These transactions are accounted for as ‘pass through’ transfers that result in derecognition if the Group: (i) Has no obligation to make payments unless it colle cts equivalent amounts from the assets; (ii) Is prohibited from selling or pledging the assets; and (iii) Has an obligation to remit any cash it collects from the assets without material delay. Collateral (shares and bonds) furnished by the Group under standard repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions are not derecognised b ecause the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards on the basis of the predetermined repurchase price, and the criteria for derecognition are therefore not met. This also applies to certain securitisation transactions in which the Group retai ns a subordinated residual interest. 1.2.1. 2 Financial liabilities (i) Classification and subsequent measurement IFRS9(4.2.1) IFRS9(B5.7.16) In both the current and prior period, financial liabilities are classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost, except for: Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss: this classification is applied to derivatives, financial liabilities held for trading (e.g. short positions in the trading booking) and other financial liabilities designated as such at initial recognition. Gains or losses on financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss are presented partially in other comprehensive income (the amount of change in the fair value of the financial liability that is attributable t o changes in the credit risk of that liability, which is determined as the amount that is not attributable to changes in market conditions that give rise to market risk) and partially profit or loss (the remaining amount of change in the fair value of the liability). This is unless such a presentation would create, or enlarge, an accounting mismatch, in',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 22 which case the gains and losses attributable to changes in the credit risk of the liability are also presented in profit or loss; Financial liabilities aris ing from the transfer of financial assets which did not qualify for derecognition, whereby a financial liability is recognised for the consideration received for the transfer. In subsequent periods, the Group recognises any expense incurred on the financia l liability; and Financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments (see note 1.3). (ii) Derecognition IFRS9(3.3.1) Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished (i.e. when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, canc elled or expires). IFRS9(3.3.2), (3.3.3), (B3.3.6) The exchange between the Group and its original lenders of debt instruments with substantially different terms, as well as substantial modifications of the terms of existing financial liabilities, are acc ounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. The terms are substantially different if the discounted present value of the cash flows under the new terms, including any fees paid net o f any fees received and discounted using the original effective interest rate, is at least 10% different from the discounted present value of the remaining cash flows of the original financial liability. In addition, other qualitative factors, such as the currency that the instrument is denominated in, changes in the type of interest rate, new conversion features attached to the instrument and change in covenants are also taken into consideration. If an exchange of debt instruments or modification of terms is accounted for as an extinguishment, any costs or fees incurred are recognised as part of the gain or loss on the extinguishment. If the exchange or modification is not accounted for as an extinguishment, any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying am ount of the liability and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified liability. 1.2.2 Financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments IFRS9 (Appendix A) Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due, in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Such financial guarantees are given to banks, financial institutions and others on behalf o f customers to secure loans, overdrafts and other banking facilities. IFRS9(4.2.1) Financial guarantee contracts are initially measured at fair value and subs equently measured at the higher of: The amount of the loss allowance (calculated as described in note 3.1.2) ; and The premium received on initial recognition less income recognised in accordance with the prin ciples of IFRS 15. IFRS9(2.3) Loan commitments provided by the Group are measured as the amount of the loss allowance (calculated as described i n note 3.1.2). The Group has not provided any c ommitment to provide loans at a below -market interest rate, or that can be settled net in cash or by deliveri ng or issuing another financial instrument. IFRS7(B8E) For loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts, the loss allowance is recognised as a provision. However, for contracts that include both a loan and an undrawn commitment and the Group cannot separately identify the expected credit losses on the undrawn commitment component from those on the loan component, the expected credit losses on the undrawn commitment are recognised together with the loss allowance for the loan. To the extent that the combined expected credit losses exceed the gross carrying amount of the loan, the expected credit los ses are recognised as a provision. 1.2.3 Derivatives and hedging activities IFRS9(7.2.21) The Group has elected to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 on adoption of IFRS 9. IFRS7(44Z) The Group has not provided comparative in formation for periods before the date of initial application of IFRS 9 for the new disclosures introduced by IFRS 9 as a consequential amendment to IFRS 7, as permitted by IFRS 7 paragraph 44Z.',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 23 Disclosures not illustrated as not applicable to the Group For the purposes of these Illustrative financial statements, the Group has not adopted the new hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9. Nevertheless, the rev ised hedge accounting disclosures introduced by the consequential amendments to IFRS 7 are applicabl e whether or not an entity has adopted the hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9 and are therefore illustrated in note 4. Where banks choose to adopt the new hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9, they will need to disclose different accounting policie s along with an explanation of the resulting impacts. IFRS9(4.1.4), (4.2.1a) Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. All derivatives are carried as assets when fair value is positive and as liabilities when fair value is negative. IFRS9(4.3.2) IFRS9(4.3.3) Certain derivatives are embedded in hybrid contracts, such as the conversion option in a convertible bond. If the hybrid contract cont ains a host that is a financial asset, then the Group assesses the entire contract as described in the financial assets section above for classification and measurement purposes. Otherwise, the embedded derivatives are treated as separate derivatives when: (i) Their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract; (ii) A separate instrument with the same terms would meet the definition of a derivative ; and (iii) The hybrid contract is not measured at fair value through profit or lo ss. These embedded derivatives are separately accounted for at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit or loss unless the Group chooses to designate the hybrid contracts at fair value through profit or loss. IAS39p86 The method of recognising the resulting fair value gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated and qualifies as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as either: (a) Hedg es of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or firm commitments (fair value hedges); (b) Hedges of highly probable future cash flows attributable to a recognised asset or liability (cash flow hedges); or (c) Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedges). IAS39p88 The Group documents, at the inception of the hedge, the relationship between hedged items and hedging instruments, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transaction s. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. IAS39p89 (a) Fair value hedge Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the statement of profit or loss, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are a ttribu table to the hedged risk. IAS39p92 If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to profit or loss over the period to maturity and r ecorded as net interest income.',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 24 IAS39p95 (b) Cash flow hedge IAS39p95 IAS39p100, IAS39p101 The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensi ve income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss. Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled to the statement of profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss. They are recorded in the income or expense lines in which the revenue or expense associated with the related hedged item is reported. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accountin g, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur (for example, the recognised hedged as set is disposed of ), the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is immediately reclassified to the statement of profit or loss. IAS39p102 (c) Net investment hedge Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are a ccounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised directly in other comprehensive income; the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised i mmediately in the statement of profit or loss. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the statement of profit or loss when the foreign operation is disposed of as part of the gain or loss on the disposal. 2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements IAS1(122), (125) The preparation of financial statements requires the use of accounting estimates which, by definition, will seldom equal the actual results. Management also needs to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting poli cies. This note provides an overview of the areas that involve a higher degree of judgement or complexity, and major sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment within the next financial year. Deta iled information about each of these estimates and judgements is included in the related notes together with information about the basis of calculation for each affected line item in the financial statements. Measurement of the expected credit loss allow ance The measurement of the expected credit loss allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI is an area that requires the use of complex models and significant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit behaviour (e.g . the likelihood of customers defaulting and the resulting losses). Explanation of the inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques used in measuring ECL is further detailed in note 3.1.2.3, which also sets out key sensitivities of the ECL to changes in these elements. A number of significant judgements are also required in applying the accounting requirements for measuring ECL, such as: Determining criteria for significant increase in credit risk; Choosing appropriate models and assumptions for the measur ement of ECL; Establishing the number and relative weighting s of forward -looking scenarios for each type of product/market and the associated ECL; and Establishing groups of similar financial assets for the purposes of measuring ECL. Detailed information about the judgements and estimates made by the Group in the above areas is set out in note 3.1.2.',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 25 PwC observation Significant judgements in measuring ECL Not all the significant judgements listed above may be relevant to all Banks. Conversely, judgements not listed above may be significant for some Banks, for example determining the relevant period of exposure to credit risk when measuring ECL for credit cards and revolving credit facilities. The disclosure provided should, therefore, be tailored appropriately. Business models and SPPI as significant judgments As well as ECL, determining the appropriate business models and assessing the SPPI requirements for financial assets may require significant accounting judgement and have a significant impact on the financia l statements, as discussed in note 1.2.1.1(i). When this is the case, these judgements should also be disclosed or cross -referenced in this section. 3. Financial risk management PwC observation – Comparative disclosures IFRS 9 introduced and modified se veral disclosure requirements in IFRS 7 in relation to credit risk and impairment of financial instruments. These new disclosures are not required to be provided for the comparative period if a bank chooses not to restate the prior period in accordance wit h the exemption provided in IFRS 9 paragraph 7.2.15. Consequently, all disclosures required by the previous version of IFRS 7 should be provided in respect of the comparative period. Such disclosures have not been illustrated in this document. The follow ing section discusses the Group’s risk management policies. The measurement of ECL under IFRS 9 uses the information and approaches that the Group uses to manage credit risk, though certain adjustments are made in order to comply with the requirements of I FRS 9. The approach taken for IFRS 9 measurement purposes is discussed separately in note 3.1.2. 3.1 Credit risk IFRS7(33)(a) Credit risk is the risk of suffering financial loss, should any of the Group’s customers, clients or market counterparties fail to fulfil their contractual obligations to the Group. Credit risk arises mainly from interbank, commercial and consumer loans and advances, and loan commitments arising from such lending activities, but can also arise from credit enhancement provided, suc h as credit derivatives ( credit default swaps), financial guarantees, letters of credit, endorsements and acceptances. The Group is also exposed to other credit risks arising from investments in debt securities and other exposures arising from its trading activities (‘trading exposures’) including non -equity trading portfolio assets and derivatives as well as settlement balances with market counte rparties and reverse repurchase agreements. Credit risk is the single largest risk for the Group’s business; man agement therefore carefully manages its exposure to credit risk. The credit risk management and control are centralised in a credit risk management team which reports regularly to the Board of Directors and head of each business unit. IFRS7 (33)(b) 3.1.1 Credit risk measurement (a) Loans and advances ( incl. loan commitments and guarantees) The estimation of credit exposure for risk management purposes is complex and requires the use of models, as the exposure varies with changes in market conditions, e xpected cash flows and the passage of time. The assessment of credit risk of a portfolio of assets entails further estimations as to the likelihood of defaults occurring, of the associated loss ratios and of default correlations between counterparties. The Group measures credit risk using Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD) and Loss Given Default (LGD). This is similar to the approach used for the purposes of measuring Expected Credit Loss (ECL) under IFRS 9. Refer to note 3.1.2 for more details.',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 26 Credit risk grading The Group uses internal credit risk gradings that reflect its assessment of the probability of default of individual counterparties. The Group use internal rating models tailored to the various categories of counterparty . Borrower and loan specific information collected at the time of application (such as disposable income, and level of collateral for retail exposures; and turnover and industry type for wholesale exposures) is fed into this rating model. This is supplemented w ith external data such as credit bureau scoring information on individual borrowers. In addition, the models enable expert judgement from the Credit Risk Officer to be fed into the final internal credit rating for each exposure. This allows for considerati ons which may not be captured as part of the other data inputs into the model. The credit grades are calibrated such that the risk of default increases exponentially at each higher risk grade. For example, this means that the difference in the PD between a n A and A - rating grade is lower than the difference in the PD between a B and B - rating grade. The following are additional considerations for each type of portfolio held by the Group: Retail After the date of initial recognition, for retail business, the payment behaviour of the borrower is monitored on a periodic basis to develop a behavioural score. Any other known information about the borrower which impact s their creditworthiness – Such as unemployment and previous delinquency history – is also incorp orated into the behavioural score. This score is mapped to a PD. Wholesale For wholesale business, the rating is determined at the borrower level. A relationship manager will incorporate any updated or new information/credit assessments into the credit sys tem on an ongoing basis. In addition, the relationship manager will also update information about the creditworthiness of the borrower every year from sources such as public financial statements. This will determine the updated internal credit rating and P D. Treasury For debt securities in the Treasury portfolio, external rating agency credit grades are used. These published grades are continuously monitored and updated. The PD’s associated with each grade are determined based on realised default rates over the prior 12 months, as published by the rating agency. The Group’s rating method comprises 25 rating levels for instruments not in default (1 to 25) and five default classes (26 to 30). The master scale assigns each rating category a specified range of p robabilities of default, which is stable over time. The rating methods are subject to an annual validation and recalibration so that they reflect the latest projections in the light of all actually observed defaults.',\n",

It has been included as it provides useful information to users of the financial statements in understanding the entity’s risk management practices and evaluating the nature of risks arising from financi al instruments in line wit h the disclosure objective in paragraph 31 of IFRS 7. 3.1.2 Expected credit loss measurement IFRS 9 outlines a ‘three -stage’ model for impairment based on changes in credit quality since initial recognition as summarised below: A financial instrument that is not credit -impaired on initial recognition is classified in ‘Stage 1’ and has its credit risk continuously monitored by the Group. If a significant increase in credit risk (‘SICR’) since initial recognition is identified, the financial instrument is moved to ‘Stage 2’ but is not yet deemed to be credit -impaired. Please refer to note 3.1.2.1 for a description of how the Group determines when a significant increase in credit risk has occurred. If the financial instrument is credit -impaired, the financial inst rument is then moved to ‘Stage 3’. Please refer to note 3.1.2.2 for a description of how the Group defines credit -impaired and default. Financial instruments in Stage 1 have their ECL measured at an amount equal to the portion of lifetime expected credit l osses that result from default events possible within the next 12 months. Instruments in Stages 2 or 3 have their ECL measured based on expected credit losses on a lifetime basis. Please refer to note 3.1.2.3 for a description of inputs, assumptions and es timation techniques used in measuring the ECL. A pervasive concept in measuring ECL in accordance with IFRS 9 is that it should consider forward - looking information. Note 3.1.2.4 includes an explanation of how the Group has incorporated this in its ECL mod els. Purchased or originated credit -impaired financial assets are those financial assets that are credit - impaired on initial recognition. Their ECL is always measured on a lifetime basis (Stage 3). Further explanation is also provided of how the Group dete rmines appropriate groupings when ECL is measured on a collective basis (refer to note 3.1.2.5). The following diagram summarises the impairment requirements under IFRS 9 (other than purchased or originated credit -impaired financial assets): Change in c redit quality since initial recognition Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 (Initial recognition) (Significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition) (Credit -impaired assets) 12-month expected credit losses Lifetime expected credit losses Lifetim e expected credit losses The key judgements and assumptions adopted by the Group in addressing the requirements of the standard are discussed below:',\n",

If at the current reporting date the lifetime PD is actually [Z]% and this exceeds the expected PD of [Y]% by more than the threshold shown above, then a significant increase in credit risk has occurred.',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 30 These thresholds have been determined separately for Retail Mortgages, Other retail products and Wholesale, by assessing how the Lifetime PD moves prior to an instrument becoming delinquent. The Lifetime PD movements on instruments which do not subsequently become delinquent have also been assessed, to identify the “natural” movement in Lifetime PD which is not considered indicative of a significant increase in credit risk.

In relation to Wholesale and Treasury financial instruments, where a Watchlist is used to monitor credit risk, this assessment is performed at the counterparty level and on a periodic basis. The criteri a used to identify SICR are monitored and reviewed periodically for appropriateness by the independent Credit Risk team. PwC observation – Disclosure of SICR criteria In the illustrative disclosure presented above, consistent criteria have been applied t o each of Retail Mortgages, Other retail products and Wholesale.

Qualitative criteria The borrower meets unlikeliness to pay criteria, which indicates the borrower is in significant financial difficulty. These are instances where: The borrower is in long-term forbearance The borrower is deceased The borrower is insolvent The borrower is in breach of financial covenant(s) An active market for that financial asset has disappeared because of financial difficulties Concessions have been made by the lender relating to the borrower’s financial difficulty It is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 32 Financial assets are purchased or originated at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit losses. The criteria above have been applied to all financial instruments held by the Group and are consistent with the definition of default used for internal credit risk management purposes. The default definition has been applied consistently to model the Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD) and Loss given Default (LGD) throughout the Group’s expected loss calculations . IFRS7(B8A)(b) The 180 days past due default definition used for prime retail mortgages has been aligned with the definition u sed for regulatory capital purposes. Furthermore, the Group performed an analysis which shows that the cure rate (the proportion of instruments which would have moved out of default back to Stage 2 or Stage 1) after 90 days past due is [X]% (compared to [Y ]% after 180 days past due) and therefore 90 days past due is not considered an appropriate default definition. Therefore, the Group considers 180 days past due to be a more appropriate default definition and has rebutted the 90 days past due presumption u nder IFRS 9 for the prime retail mortgage portfolio. This rebuttal will be monitored and reviewed by the Credit Risk department on an annual basis to ensure it remains appropriate. IFRS7(B8A)(c) An instrument is considered to no longer be in default (i.e. to have cured) when it no longer meets any of the default criteria for a consecutive period of six months. This period of six months has been determined based on an analysis which considers the likelihood of a financial instrument returning to default sta tus after cure using different possible cure definitions. IFRS7(35G)(a) 3.1.2.3 Measuring ECL – Explanation of inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques The Expected Credit Loss (ECL) is measured on either a 12 -month (12M) or Lifetime basis dependin g on whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred since initial recognition or whether an asset is considered to be credit -impaired. Expected credit losses are the discounted product of the Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EA D), and Loss Given Default (LGD), defined as follows: The PD represents the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on its financial obligation (as per “Definition of default and credit -impaired ” above), either over the next 12 months (12M PD), or over the remaining lifetime (Lifetime PD) of the obligation. EAD is based on the amounts the Group expects to be owed at the time of default, over the next 12 months (12M EAD) or over the remaining lifetime (Lifetime EAD). For example, for a revolving commitment, the Group includes the current drawn balance plus any further amount that is expected to be drawn up to the current contractual limit by the time of default, should it occur. Loss Given Default (LGD) represents the Group’s expectation of the extent of loss on a defaulted exposure. LGD varies by type of counterparty, type and seniority of claim and availability of collateral or other credit support. LGD is expressed as a percentage loss per unit of exposure at the time of default (EAD). LGD is calculated on a 12 -month or lifetime basis, where 12-month LGD is the percentage of loss expected to be made if the default occurs in the next 12 months and Lifetime LGD is the percentage of loss expected to be made if the default occurs over the remaining expected lifetime of the loan. The ECL is determined by projecting the PD, LGD and EAD for each future month and for each individual exposure or collective segment. These three components are multiplied together and adjusted for the likelihood of survival (i.e. the exposur e has not prepaid or defaulted in an earlier month). This effectively calculates an ECL for each future month, which is then discounted back to the reporting date and summed. The discount rate used in the ECL calculation is the original effective interest rate or an approximation thereof . IFRS7(35G)(a)(i) The Lifetime PD is developed by applying a maturity profile to the current 12M PD. The maturity profile looks at how defaults develop on a portfolio from the point of initial recognition throughout the li fetime of the loans. The maturity profile is based on historical observed data and is assumed to be the same across all assets within a portfolio and credit grade band. This is supported by historical analysis. The 12 -month and lifetime EADs are determin ed based on the expected payment profile , which varies by product type.',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 33 For amortising products and bullet repayment loans, this is based on the contractual repayments owed by the borrower over a 12month or lifetime basis. This will also be adjusted for an y expected overpayments made by a borrower. Early repayment/refinance assumptions are also incorporated into the calculation . For revolving products, the exposure at default is predicted by taking current drawn balance and adding a “credit conversion facto r” which allows for the expected drawdown of the remaining limit by the time of default. These assumptions vary by product type and current limit utilisation band, based on analysis of the Group’s recent default data. The 12 -month and lifetime LGDs are det ermined based on the factors which impact the recoveries made post defau lt. These vary by product type. For secured products, this is primarily based on collateral type and projected collateral values, historical discounts to market/book values due to forc ed sales, time to repossession and recovery costs observed. For unsecured products, LGD’s are typically set at product level due to the limited differentiation in recoveries achieved across different borrowers. These LGD’s are influenced by collection stra tegies, including contracted debt sales and price. Forward -looking economic information is also included in determining the 12 -month and lifetime PD, EAD and LGD. These assumptions vary by product type. Refer to note 3.1.2.4 for an explanation of forwar d- looking information and its inclusion in ECL calculations. The assumptions underlying the ECL calculation – such as how the maturity profile of the PDs and how collateral values change etc. – are monitored and reviewed on a quarterly basis. IFRS7(35G) (c) There have been no significant changes in estimation techniques or significant assumptions made during the reporting period. IFRS7(35G)(b) 3.1.2.4 F orward -looking information incorporated in the ECL models The assessment of SICR and the calculation of ECL both incorporate forward -looking information. The Group has performed historical analysis and identified the key economic variables impacting credit risk and expected credit losses for each portfolio. These economic variables and their associated im pact on the PD, EAD and LGD vary by financial instrument. Expert judgment has also been applied in this process. Forecasts of these economic variables (the “base economic scenario ”) are provided by the Group’s Economics team on a quarterly basis and provid e the best estimate view of the economy over the next five years. After five years, to project the economic variables out for the full remaining lifetime of each instrument, a mean reversion approach has been used, which means that economic variables tend to either a long run average rate (e.g. for unemployment) or a long run average growth rate (e.g. GDP) over a period of two to five years. The impact of these economic variables on the PD, EAD and LGD has been determined by performing statistical regressio n analysis to understand the impact changes in these variables have had historically on default rates a nd on the components of LGD and EAD. In addition to the base economic scenario, the Group’s Economics team also provide other possible scenarios along wi th scenario weightings . The number of other scenarios used is set based on the analysis of each major product type to ensure non -linearities are captured. The number of scenarios and their attributes are reassessed at e ach reporting date. At 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2018, for all but two portfolios the Group concluded that three scenarios appropriately captured non -linearities. For portfolios [X] and [Y], the Group concluded that two additional downside scenarios w ere required. The scenario weighting s are determined by a combination of statistical analysis and expert credit judgement , taking account of the range of possible outcomes each chosen scenario is representative of . The assessment of SICR is performed using the Lifetime PD under each of the base , and the other scenarios, multiplied by the associated scenario weighting , along with qualitative and backstop indicators (see note 3.1.2.1). This determines whether the whole financial instrument is in Stage 1, Stage 2, or Stage 3 and hence whether 12 -month or lifetime ECL should be recorded. Following this assessment, the Group measures ECL as either a probability weighted 12 month ECL (Stage 1), or a probability weighted lifetime ECL (Stage s 2 and 3). These probability -weighted ECLs are determined by running',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 34 each scenario through the relevant ECL model and multiplying it by the appropriate scenario weighting (as opposed to weighting the inputs). As with any economic forecasts, the projections and likelihoods of occurrence are subject to a high degree of inherent uncertainty and therefore the actual outcomes may be significantly different to those projected. The Group considers these forecasts to represent its best estimate of the possible outcomes and has analysed the non -linearities and asymmetries within the Group’s different portfolios to establish that the chosen scenarios are appropr iately representative of the range of possible scenarios.

For illustrative purposes only, the same three forward -looking macroecon omic scenarios have been considered appropriate for all but two of the portfolios held by the Group. In practice, Banks will have to determine for each material portfolio both the appropriate number of scenarios to be used and what those scenarios should b e, taking account of the types of products, geographies etc. to which they are exposed and the resulting nonlinearities and potential losses. In the above illustrative disclosure, management has concluded that no additional provision or “overlay ” is requir ed for regulatory, legislative or political changes. However, where major events occur close to the reporting date, so that the potential effects are not appropriately captured in models and inputs, this may well be a key area of judgement that also requir es greater disclosure. More recent examples of such events include the UK “Brexit ” vote to leave the EU. Sensitivity analysis IAS1(129) The most significant assumptions affecting the ECL allowance are as follows: Retail portfolios (i) House price index, given the significant impact it has on mortgage collateral valuations; and (ii) Unemployment rate, given its impact on secured and unsecured borrowers’ ability to meet their contractual repayments. Wholesale portfolios (i) GDP, given the significant impact on companie s’ perform ance and collateral valuations; and (ii) Interest rate, given its impact on companies’ likelihood of default.

Furthermore, Banks should also consider the appropriate level of granularity for these disclosures, which may vary depending on the characteristics of their different portfolios and which elements of the ECL cal culation have the greatest impact. IFRS7(35F)(c) 3.1.2.5 Grouping of instruments for losses measured on a collective basis For expected credit loss provisions modelled on a collective basis, a grouping of exposures is performed on the basis of shared risk characteristics, such that risk exposures within a group are homogeneous. In performing this grouping, there must be sufficient information for the group to be statistically credible. Where sufficient information is not available internally, the Grou p has considered benchmarking internal/external supplementary data to use for modelling purposes.

Providing these disclosures in the same tabl e avoids duplication of information, as often the gross carrying amount also represents the maximum exposure to credit risk on financial instruments subject to IFRS 9 impairment requirements. However, the disclosure in paragraph 35K of IFRS 7 should be pro vided by each class of financial instrument, including loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts when material. IFRS 7 paragraph 6 requires grouping of financial instruments into classes that are appropriate to the nature of the information disclo sed and that take into account the characteristics of those financial instruments. The level at which ‘class’ is defined can vary across different disclosure requirements. Therefore, judgement should be applied in determining the classes of financial instrument to be disclosed, which will often be on a more granular level than the balance sheet line items.

The most common of these is accepting collateral for funds advanced. The Group has internal policies on the acceptability of specific classes of collat eral or credit risk mitigation. The Group prepares a valuation of the collateral obtained as part of the loan origination process. This assessment is reviewed periodically . The principal collateral types for loans and advances are: Mortgages over residential properties; Margin agreement for derivatives, for which the Group has also entered into master netting agreements; Charges over business assets such as premises, inventory and accounts receivable; and Charges over financial instruments such as debt securities and equities. Longer -term finance and lending to corporate entities are generally secured; revolving individual credit facilities are generally unsecured. Collateral held as securi ty for financial assets other than loans and advances depends on the nature of the instrument. Debt securities, treasury and other eligible bills are generally unsecured, with the exception of asset -backed securities and similar instruments, which are secu red by portfolios of financial instruments. Derivatives are also collateralised . IFRS7(35K)(b)(ii) The Group’s policies regarding obtaining collateral have not significantly changed during the reporting period and there has been no significant change in t he overall quality of the collateral held by the Group since the prior period. IFRS7 (35K)(b)(iii) A portion of the Group’s financial assets originated by the mortgage business has sufficiently low ‘loan to value’ (LTV) ratios, which results in no loss al lowance being recognised in accordance with the Group’s expected credit loss model.

However, we note that paragraph B8F of IFRS 7 clarifies that entities are neither required to disclose information ab out the fair value of collateral and other credit enhancements nor to quantify the exact value of the collateral included in the calculation of ECL.

Banks should also consider whether there are other material causes of movement that should be shown separately. These might, for example, be shown in the analysis prepared internally for senior management. Additiona l rows may also be required to explain ECL movements for different types of products. Where ECL allowance movements could potentially be reported in more than one row, explanation of which changes are reported in which row will assist users of the financi al statements. Similarly, where',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 43 changing the order in which key drivers are changed could result in a significantly different allocation between rows, explanation of the ordering used will be useful. Banks should also consider disclosing whether ECL moveme nts from transfers between stages are measured at the beginning or the end of the reporting periods. 2 When applicable, separate presentation (for example, in an additional column) is also required for trade receivables, contract assets or lease receivables for which loss allowances are measured in accordance with paragraph 5.5.15 of IFRS 9 using the ‘simplified’ approach. 3 The loss allowance for financial assets measured at fair value through OCI shall not be presented separately in the statement of financial position as a reduction of the carrying amount of the financial asset, but should be disclosed in the notes. 4 The reconciliation presented above splits items between those that impact P&L and those that do not. This is not an explicit requirement of IFRS 7 paragraph 35H, however this information is likely to be helpful to users in understanding the impact of the various movements in ECL allowance. IFRS7(35I) Significant changes in the gross carrying amount of financial assets that contributed to changes i n the loss allowance were as follows: The high volume of new mortgages loans originat ed during the period, aligned with the Group’s organic growth objective, increased the gross carrying amount of the mortgage book by 13%, with a corresponding CU 18 increa se in loss allowance measured on a 12 -month basis. The modification of mortgage contracts following renegotiation with customers facing financial difficulties resulted in a reduction of CU 61,000 in the gross carrying amount of Stage 3 mortgages. This also resulted in the reversal of CU 36,000 of Stage 3 loss allowance. Also refer to note 3.1.6. The write -off of mortgage loans with a total gross carrying amount of CU 57,000 resulted in the reduction of the Stage 3 loss allowance by the same amount. IFRS7(3 5I) The following table further explains changes in the gross carrying amount of the mortgage portfolio to help explain their significance to the changes in the loss allowance for the same portfolio as discussed above: Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Purchased credit - impaired Total Retail Mortgages 12- month ECL Lifetime ECL Lifetime ECL CU’000 CU’000 CU’000 CU’000 CU’000 Gross carrying amount as at 1 January 2018 54,475 1,537 1,309 72 57,393 Transfers: Transfer from Stage 1 to Stage 2 (1,345) 1,345 – – – Transfer from Stage 1 to Stage 3 (120) – 120 – – Transfer from Stage 2 to Stage 3 – (166) 166 – – Transfer from Stage 3 to Stage 2 – 3 (3) – – Transfer from Stage 2 to Stage 1 33 (33) – – – Financial assets derecognised during the period other than write -offs (4,862) (166) (28) – (5,056) New financial assets originated or purchased 7,619 – – 6 7,625 Modification of contractual cash flows of financial assets – – (61) – (61) Changes in interest accrual 2,233 64 33 – 2,330 Write -offs – – (57) – (57) FX and other movements 109 7 – – 116 Gross carrying amount as at 31 December 2018 58,142 2,591 1,479 78 62,290 [The disclosures above should be repeated for each class of financial instrument, but are omitted here for illustrative purposes].',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 44 PwC observation – Reconciliation of gross carrying amount IFRS 7 paragraph 35I does not explicitly require the gross carrying amount of financial instruments to be reconciled. However, a reconciliation table, in addition to narrative disclosures, is includ ed in IFRS 7 paragraph IG20B as an illustration of how the information required by that paragraph can be provided. In our view, including such a reconciliation table will typically be the most helpful way of meeting these disclosure requirements. Movement descriptions in this table may need to be amended based on product types (e.g. a specific line for ‘additional drawings’ on existing drawn facilities). If included, this table should also be provided for each class of financial instrument. IFRS7(35H)(c) The total amount of undiscounted expected credit losses at initial recognition for purchased or originated credit -impaired financial assets recognised during the period was CU 10,000. 3.1.5 Write -off policy IFRS7(35F)(e) The Group writes off financial a ssets, in whole or in part, when it has exhausted all practical recovery efforts and has concluded there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include (i) ceasing enforcement activity and (ii) where the Group’s recovery method is foreclosing on collateral and the value of the collateral is such that there is no reasonable expectation of recovering in full. IFRS7(35F)(e) IFRS7(35L) The Group may write -off financial assets that are still subj ect to enforcement activity. The outstanding contractual amounts of such assets written off during the year ended 31 December 2018 was CU 41,000. The Group still seeks to recover amounts it is legally owed in full, but which have been partially written off due to no reasonable expectation of full recovery. 3.1.6 Modification of financial assets The Group sometimes modifies the terms of loans provided to customers due to commercial renegotiations, or for distressed loans, with a view to maximising recove ry. Such restructuring activities include extended payment term arrangements, payment holidays and payment forgiveness. Restructuring policies and practices are based on indicators or criteria which, in the judgement of management, indicate that payment will most likely continue. These policies are kept under continuous review. Restructuring is most commonly applied to term loans. IFRS7(35F)(f)(i) IFRS7(35J)(b) The risk of default of such assets after modification is assessed at the reporting date and co mpared with the risk under the original terms at initial recognition, when the modification is not substantial and so does not result in derecognition of the original asset (refer to notes 1.2.1.1(iv) and (v) above). The Group monitors the subsequent perfo rmance of modified assets. The Group may determine that the credit risk has significantly improved after restructuring, so that the assets are moved from Stage 3 or Stage 2 (Lifetime ECL) to Stage 1 (12 -month ECL). This is only the case for assets which ha ve performed in accordance with the new terms for six consecutive months or more . The gross carrying amount of such assets held as at 31 December 2018 was CU 41,000. IFRS7(35F)(f)(ii) The Group continues to monitor if there is a subsequent significant in crease in credit risk in relation to such assets through the use of specific models for modified assets. IFRS7(35J)(a) The following table includes summary information for financial assets with lifetime ECL whose cash flows were modified during the period as part of the Group’s restructuring activities and their respective effect on the Group’s financial performance: Loans and advance to customers CU’000 Amortised cost before modification 234 Net modification (loss) (61)',\n",

W hile not required by IFRS 7, Banks may, therefore, wish to explain this, with disclosure such as: ‘The net modification loss above represents the changes in the gross carrying amounts (i.e. before impairment allowance) of the financial assets from immediat ely before, to immediately after, modification. In the significant majority of cases, this gross loss had been anticipated and already materially reflected within the ECL allowance. The impact of modification on the ECL allowances associated with these ass ets was a release of ECL allowances of CU[X]. The net impact on the statement of profit or loss for the period was, therefore, CU[X].’ 4. Hedge accounting disclosures The Group applies hedge accounting in three separate hedging strategies, as follows: Interest rate risk on fixed rate mortgages (fair value hedge) IFRS7(22A)(a), (22B)(a) The Group holds a portfolio of long-term fixed rate mortgages and therefore is exposed to changes in fair value due to movements in market interest rates. The Group man ages this risk exposure by entering into pay fixed /receive floating interest rate swaps. IFRS7( 22A)(b), (22B)(b), (22C) Only the interest rate risk element is hedged and therefore other risks, such as credit risk, are managed but not hedged by the Group. The interest rate risk component is determined as the change in fair value of the long -term fixed rate mortgages arising solely from changes in 3 -month LIBOR (the benchmark rate of interest). Such changes are usually the largest component of the overall c hange in fair value. This strategy is designated as a fair value hedge and its effectiveness is assessed by comparing changes in the fair value of the loans attributable to changes in the benchmark rate of interest with changes in the fair value of the int erest rate swaps. IFRS7 (22B)(c), (23D) The Group establishes the hedging ratio by matching the notional of the derivatives with the principal of the portfolio being hedged. Possible sources of ineffectiveness are as follows: (i) differences between the expect ed and actual volume of prepayments, as the Group hedges to the expected repayment date taking into account expected prepayments based on past experience; (ii) difference in the discounting between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, as cash collaterali sed interest rate swaps are discounted using Overnight Indexed Swaps (OIS) discount curves, which are not applied to the fixed rate mortgages; (iii) hedging derivatives with a non -zero fair value at the date of initial designation as a hedging instrument; and (iv) counterparty credit risk which impacts the fair value of uncollateralised interest rate swaps but not the hedged items. IFRS7( 23C) The Group manages the interest rate risk arising from fixed rate mortgages by entering into interest rate swaps on a monthly b asis. The exposure from this portfolio frequently changes due to new loans originated, contractual repayments and early prepayments made by customers in each period. As a result, the Group adopts a dynamic hedging strategy (sometimes referred to as a ‘macr o’ or ‘portfolio’ hedge) to hedge the exposure profile by closing and entering into new swap agreements at each month -end. The Group uses the portfolio fair value hedge of interest rate risk to recognise fair value changes related to changes in interest ra te risk in the mortgage portfolio, and therefore reduce the profit or loss volatility that would otherwise arise from changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps alone.',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 46 IFRS7(24D) Disclosures not illustrated as not applicable to the Group Paragraph 2 3C of IFRS 7 exempts entities from disclosing the profile of the timing of the nominal amounts and the average price or rate of the hedging instruments for ‘macro’ hedges – as in such hedges entities frequently reset the hedging relationship – and instead requires the disclosure of information included in the illustrative disclosure above. When the volume of such hedging relationships is unrepresentative of normal volumes during the period (i.e. the volume at the reporting date does not reflect the volumes during the period) , an entity shall disclose that fact and the reason it believes the volumes are unrepresentative. Foreign exchange risk on foreign currency debt (cash flow hedge) IFRS7( 22A)(a), (22A)(b), (22A)(c), (22B)(a), (22C) The Group accesses i nternational markets in order to obtain effective sources of funding. As part of this process, the Group assumes significant foreign currency exposure, principally USD. The foreign currency risk component is then managed and mitigated by the use of cross c urrency swaps, which exchange fixed interest payments in the foreign currency for fixed interest payments in CU. These instruments are entered into to match the maturity profile of estimated repayments of the Group’s debt instruments. This hedging strategy is applied to the portion of the exposure that is not naturally offset against matching asset positions held by the Group in financial investments also denominated in foreign currencies. The foreign currency risk component is determined as the change in c ash flows of the foreign currency debt arising solely from changes in the relevant foreign currency forward exchange rate. Such changes constitute a significant component of the overall changes in cash flows of the instrument. IFRS7 22B(b) The effectivene ss of this strategy is assessed by comparing the changes in fair value of the cross currency swap with changes in fair value of the hedged debt attributable to the hedged risk ( changes in foreign currency forward exchange rates ), using the hypothetical der ivative method. IFRS7( 22B)(c), (23D) The Group establishes the hedging ratio by matching the notional of the derivative with the principal of the specific debt instrument being hedged (sometimes referred to as a ‘micro’ hedge). Possible sources of ineffec tiveness are as follows: (i) Differences in timing of cash flows between debt instruments and cross currency swaps; (ii) Differences in the discounting between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, as cash collateralised cross currency swaps are discounted us ing Overnight Indexed Swaps (OIS) discount curves, which are not applied to the foreign debt; (iii) Hedging derivatives with a non -zero fair value at the date of initial designation as a hedging instrument; and (iv) Counterparty credit risk which impacts the fair val ue of uncollateralised cross currency swaps but not the hedged items. IFRS7( 23F) Disclosures not illustrated as not applicable to the Group For cash flow hedges, an entity shall also disclose a description of any forecast transaction for which hedge acco unting had been used in the previous period, but which is no longer expected to occur. Net investment in foreign operation (net investment hedge) IFRS7( 22A)(a), (22A)(b), (22A)(c), (22B)(a), (22B)(b) The Group has an investment in a foreign operation w hich is consolidated in its financial statements and whose functional currency is US Dollars. The foreign exchange rate exposure arising from this investment is hedged through the use of two year FX forward contracts. These contracts are entered into to he dge 90% of the exposure arising from the net assets held in the foreign operation and are rolled forward on a periodic basis. The Group only designates the undiscounted spot element of the FX forwards as hedging instruments. Changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments attributable to changes in forward points and the effect of discounting are recognised directly in profit or loss within the “Net trading income ” line – These amounts are, therefore, not included in the hedge effectiveness assessmen t. IFRS7( 22B)(c), (23D), (22C) The Group establishes the hedging ratio by matching the notional of the forward contracts with 90% of the net assets of the foreign operation. Given that only the undiscounted spot element of the FX forwards is designated i n the hedging relationship, no ineffectiveness is expected unless the foreign operation’s',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 47 losses exceed 10% of net assets during the reporting period. The foreign currency risk component is determined as the change in the carrying amount of net assets of t he foreign operation arising solely from changes in spot foreign currency exchange rates. IFRS7( 23E) Disclosures not illustrated as not applicable to the Group If other sources of hedge ineffectiveness emerge in a hedging relationship, an entity shall dis close those sources by risk category and explain the resulting hedge ineffectiveness. IFRS7( 23B) The following table sets out the maturity profile and average price/rate of the hedging instruments used in the Group’s non -dynamic hedging strategies: Maturity Up to one month One to three months Three months to one year One year to five years More than five years CU’000 CU’000 CU’000 CU’000 CU’000 Cash flow hedges Foreign exchange Cross currency interest rate swap Notional 120 234 443 2,312 652 Average fixed interest rate 5.30% 5.31% 6.34% 9.25% 9.56% Average CU/USD exchange rate 1.23 1.27 1.43 1.51 2.01 Net investment hedge Foreign exchange FX forward Notional – – – 587 – Average CU/USD exchange rate – – – 1.47 – PwC observation – Hedges of multiple risk categories Hedging disclosures are generally required to be provided by risk category.

Other disclosures PwC observation – Additional new disclosures introduced by IFRS 9 This note highlights additional new d isclosures required by IFRS 9 that Banks should consider when preparing their financial statements under IFRS 9. 5.1 Financial liabilities designated at FVPL The Group issued a 15 -year note in 2015 with an annual fixed coupon of 4% and which contained a call option that is not closely related to the host contract. The Group designated the entire hybrid contract as a financial liability at fair value through profit or loss. IFRS7 (10)(b) The contractual undiscounted amount that will be required to be pai d at maturity of the above structured note is CU 951,000 greater than its carrying amount of CU 1,791,000. At 31 December 2018, the cumulative own credit adjustment gain amounted to CU 83,000. The cumulative gain is recognised within ‘Other Reserves’ in Equity. Disclosures not illustrated as not applicable to the Group The disclosures requirements in relation to financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss have not changed significantly under IFRS 9. However, the following additional disclosures, which were not applicable to the Group, need to be presented when applicable: IFRS7 (10)(c), (10)(d) (i) For financial liabilities designated at fair value for which changes in the liability’s credit risk are recognised OCI, in addition to disclosure of the cumulative changes in fair value attributable to changes in credit risk of that financial liability and the difference between its carrying amount and the amount contractually required to be paid at maturity (which are also required for f inancial liabilities with all changes presented in profit or loss), disclosure should also be given of transfers of the cumulative gain or loss within equity during the period and the reason for these transfer, and the amount (if any) presented in OCI that was realised on derecognition of f inancial liabilities during the period. IFRS7 (11)(c) (ii) A detailed description of the methodology used to determine whether presenting effects of changes in a liability’s credit risk in OCI would create or enlarge an accou nting mismatch. If an entity is required by paragraph 5.7.8 of IFRS 9 to present the effects of changes in a liability’s credit risk in profit or loss for this reason, the disclosure must include a detailed description of the economic relationship between the characteristics of the liability and the characteristics of the other financial instruments whose change in fair value is expected to be offset within profit or loss. 5.2 Investments in equity instruments designated at FVOCI IFRS7 (11A)(a), (b) The Gr oup has designated at FVOCI investments in a small portfolio of equity securities issued by the following clearing houses and exchanges: Clearing House A; Clearing House B; Exchange C; and Exchange D. The Group chose this presentation alternative because the investments were made for strategic purposes rather than with a view to profit on a subsequent sale, and there are no plans to dispose of these investments in the short or medium term. IFRS7 (11A)(c), (d),(e) The fair value of these investments is CU 753,000 as at 31 December 2018. There was no dividend recognised during the period nor transfers of the cumulative gain within equity.',\n",

Such reclassifications under IFRS 9 are expected to be rare in practice and therefo re have not been illustrated in this document. The following are the disclosures that should be presented when applicable: IFRS7 (12B) For each such reclassification, in the current or previous reporting periods, the following should be disclosed: (a) The date of reclassification; (b) A detailed explanation of the change in business model and a qualitative description of its effect on the Bank’s financial statements; and (c) The amount reclassified into and out of each category. IFRS7 (12C) For each reporting period fo llowing a reclassification from FVPL to amortised cost or FVOCI, until derecognition, the Bank should disclose: (a) The effective interest rate determined on the date of reclassification; and (b) The interest revenue recognised. IFRS7 (12D) If, since its last annu al reporting date, a Bank has reclassified a financial asset (i) from FVOCI to amortised cost, or (ii) from FVPL to amortised cost or FVOCI, it shall disclose: (a) The fair value of the financial asset at the end of the period ; and (b) The fair value gain or loss that would have been recognised in profit or loss or OCI during the reporting period if the financial assets had not been reclassified. 5.4 Net gains/(losses) on derecognition of financial assets measured at amortised cost IFRS7 (20A) During the period, the Group sold a portfolio of loans to customers due to a credit risk management decision to eliminate the exposure following a deterioration in credit risk . The Group incurred a loss of CU 12,000 on the sale.',\n",

       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 1 This publication presents illustrative disclosures introduced or modified by IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’ for a fictional medium -sized bank. We have illustrated a realistic set of disclosures for a medium -sized bank. However, as this publication is a reference tool, we have not removed any disclosures based on materiality. Con sequently, some of the disclosures in this publication would likely be immaterial if the bank were a ‘real life’ company. IFRS 9 allows a variety of approaches in measuring expected credit losses (ECL) and industry thinking continues to evolve at the date of this publication . Banks will need to take account of their individual circumstances in determining the approach taken to measuring ECL and the appropriate disclosures . The approaches illustrated in this publication are one possible way the requirement s of IFRS 9 ECL may be met but are not intended to provide any view on the type of approach that should be applied . Using this publication The source for each disclosure requirement is given in the reference column. There is also commentary that (i) explains some of the most challenging areas, or (ii) lists disclosures that have not been included because they are not relevant to the fictional bank’s circumstances. The example disclosures may not be the only acceptable form of presenting financial statement di sclosures. Alternative presentations may be acceptable if they comply with the specific disclosure requirements prescribed by IFRS. Readers may find our IFRS disclosure checklist useful to identify other disclosures that may be relevant under the circumsta nces but are not illustrated in this publication (such as those highlighted in observations boxes throughout this publication). Conversely, disclosures prese nted in this publication should not be included where they are not relevant or not material in spec ific circumstances. Preparers of financial reporting should also consider local legal and regulatory requirements which may stipulate additional disclosures that are not illustrated in this publication. Specific ally, this publication does not cover the dis closure recommendations proposed by the Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF) in its ‘Impact of Expected Credit Loss Approaches on Bank Risk Disclosures ’ report. Finally, we note that, when banks provide some of the disclosures required by IFRS in section s of their Annual Reports other than the financial statements, these too need to be updated for changes introduced by IFRS 9.

Significant accounting policies 1.1 Changes in accounting policies IFRS9 (7.2.15) The Group has adopte d IFRS 9 as issued by the IASB in July 2014 with a date of transition of 1 January 2018, which resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts previously recognised in the financial statements. The Group did not early adopt any o f IFRS 9 in previous periods. As permitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the Group elected not to restate comparative figures. Any adjustments to the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the date of transition were recognised in the opening retained earnings and other reserves of the current period. The Group has also elected to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 on adoption of IFRS 9. Consequently, for notes disclosures, the consequential amendments to IFRS 7 disclosures have also only been applied to the current period. The comparative period notes disclosures repeat those disclosures made in the prior year. The adoption of IFRS 9 has resulted in changes in our accounting policies for recognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities and impairment of financial assets. IFRS 9 also significantly amends other standards dealing with financial instruments such as IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures ’. Set out below are disclosures relating to the impact of the adoption of IFRS 9 on the Group. Further details of the specific IFRS 9 accounting policies applied in the current period (as well as the previous IAS 39 accounting policies applied in the comparativ e period) are described in more detail in section 1.2 below. (a) Classification and measurement of financial instruments IFRS7 (42I)(a),(b) The measurement category and the carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities in accordance with IAS 39 an d IFRS 9 at 1 January 2018 are compared as follows: IAS 39 IFRS 9 Measurement category Carrying amount Measurement category Carrying amount Financial assets CU’000 CU’000 Cash and balances with central banks Amortised cost (Loans and receivables) 4,343 Amortised cost 4,343 Loans and advances to banks Amortised cost (Loans and receivables) 8,050 Amortised cost 7,992 Loans and advances to customers Amortised cost (Loans and receivables) 76,520 Amortised cost 68,992 FVPL (Mandatory) 6,617 Trading assets FVPL (Held for trading) 10,880 FVPL (Mandatory) 10,880 Hedging derivatives FVPL (Hedging instrument) (a) 1,654 FVPL (Mandatory) (a) 1,654 Investment securities FVOCI (Available for sale) 2,678 FVOCI 1,228 Amortised cost (Loans and Receivab les) 546 Amortised cost 2,209 Amortised cost (Held to Maturity) 1,205 FVPL (Designated) 546 FVPL (Designated) – FVPL (Embedded derivative) 12 FVPL (Mandatory) 1,536',\n",

There were no changes to the classificati on and measurement of financial liabilities, other than to changes in the fair value of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss that are attributable to changes in the instrument’s credit risk, which are now presented in other comprehensive income (refer to note 1.2.1.2(i)). PwC observation – Classification of cash and deposits with banks The classification of cash deposits is determined based on the same requirements as other financial assets. Therefore, an assessment of bus iness model and SPPI criterion should be performed based on the specific facts and circumstances. However, in most situations, the business model would be expected to be Hold to Collect (e.g. the business model would not involve selling cash balances to ot her parties) and the SPPI test would be met (e.g. as only a benchmark rate, or nil, interest is earned). (b) Reconciliation of statement of financial position balances from IAS 39 to IFRS 9 IFRS7(42J) The Group performed a detailed analysis of its busi ness models for managing financial assets and analysis of their cash flow characteristics.

Any ineffectiveness is recognised in profit or loss. The total remeasurement loss of CU 983,000 was recog nised in opening reserves at 1 January 2018. In addition, an amount of CU 120 ,000 was reclassified from retai ned earnings to other reserves at 1 January 2018 in respect of cumulative own credit a djustment s on fina ncial liabilities designated at fair value through profit and loss. The following explains how applying the new classification requirements of IFRS 9 led to changes in classification of certain financial assets held by the Group as shown in the table above: (A) Debt instruments previously classified as available fo r sale but which fail the SPPI test The Group holds a portfolio of debt instruments that failed to meet the ‘solely payments of principal and interest’ (SPPI) requirement for amortised cost classification under IFRS 9. These instruments contain provision s that, in certain circumstances, can allow the issuer to defer interest payments, but which do not accrue additional interest. This clause breaches the criterion that interest payments should only be consideration for credit risk and the time value of mon ey on the principal. As a result, these instruments, which amounted to CU 455,000, were classified as FVPL from the date of initial application. (B) Securities within the liquidity portfolio After assessing its business model for securities within t he Group’s liquidity portfolio, which are mostly held to collect the contractual cash flows and sell, the Group has identified certain securities which are managed separately and for which the past practice has been (and the Group’s intention remains) to h old to collect the contractual cash flows. Consequently, the Group assessed that the appropriate business model for this group of securities is held to collect. These securities, which amounted to CU 341,000 and which were previously classified as availabl e for sale, were classified as amortised cost from the date of initial application. The remainder of the Group’s liquidity portfolio is held to collect contractual cash flows and sell.',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 14 (C) Syndicated loans The Group acted as the lead arranger of a synd icated loan facility to one of its major customers. The facility amount requested by the customer exceeded the Group’s limit for single client exposure under the Group credit risk policy, so the facility was approved with the condition that the excess amou nt of CU 6,541,000 be sold in the medium term. Under IFRS 9, this amount exceeding the Group’s limit is classified as part of a hold to sell business model and measured at FVPL. The loan was previously measured at amortised cost in its entirety. (D) Investments in convertible loan notes The Group holds investments in convertible loan notes of CU 102,000 which are not traded in an active market. These were accounted for previously as hybrid instruments with (i) the equity conversion feature representi ng an embedded derivative separately accounted for at fair value through profit or loss (presented together with Investment Securities) and (ii) the debt host classified as a loan and receivable and measured at amortised cost. Under IFRS 9, the instruments are assessed as a whole and, due to the equity conversion feature, failed the SPPI test. Consequently, the instruments are now measured at FVPL in their entirety. (E) Investments in asset -backed securities The Group holds investments in a portfolio of fixed rate securities backed by real estate property loans which were issued by a special purpose entity. After performing detailed analysis, the Group concluded that these investments do not pass the SPPI test given the notes form part of one of the m ore subordinated tranches issued by the special purpose entity, so that the exposure to credit risk of the investment is greater than the exposure to credit risk of the underlying asset pool as a whole. As a result, this portfolio of securities, which were previously classified as available -for-sale and amounted to CU 654,000, have been reclassified to FVPL. (F) Investment in debt securities previously designated at fair value through profit or loss IFRS7(42I)(c) IFRS7(42J)(b) The Group holds an inves tment of CU 310,000 in a portfolio of debt securities which had previously been designated at fair value through profit or loss as the debt securities were managed on a fair value basis. As part of the transition to IFRS 9, these securities are part of an ‘other’ business model and so required to be classified as FVPL, instead of designated FVPL. (G) De -designation of investment in debt instrument previously designated at fair value through profit or loss IFRS7(42I)(c) IFRS7(42J)(b) The Group holds de bt instruments amounting to CU 236,000 equivalent which had previously been designated at FVPL to reduce an accounting mismatch with derivatives used in an economic hedge of interest rate risk. The Group has chosen to de -designate these financial assets up on transition to IFRS 9 and measure them at amortised cost as, subsequent to initial recognition, the Group has economically offset the original exposure with debt securities and, consequently, terminated the derivatives previously used in the economic hed ge. IFRS7(42N) The effective interest rate of these debt instruments is 8.5% per annum and CU 20,000 of interest income has been recognised during the year. IFRS7(42N) PwC observation – Disclosures of EIR and interest income for financial assets and liab ilities reclassified out of FVPL category on transition to IFRS 9 If an entity treats the fair value of a financial asset or a financial liability as the new gross carrying amount at the date of initial application (when allowed by paragraph 7.2.11 of IFRS 9), the disclosure above shall be made for each reporting period until derecognition. If an entity does not, these disclosures need not be made after the annual reporting period in which the entity initially applies the classification and measurement requ irements for financial assets in IFRS 9.',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 15 (H) Designation of equity instruments at FVOCI The Group has elected to irrevocably designate strategic investments of CU 450,000 in a small portfolio of non-trading equity securities in clearing houses and exchan ges at FVOCI as permitted under IFRS 9. These securities were previously classified as available for sale. The changes in fair value of such securities will no longer be reclassified to profit or loss when they are disposed of. (I) Reclassification fr om retired categories with no change in measurement In addition to the above, the following debt instruments have been reclassified to new categories under IFRS 9, as their previous categories under IAS 39 were ‘retired’, with no changes to their measureme nt basis: (i) Those previously classified as available for sale and now classified as measured at FVOCI ; and (ii) Those previously classified as held to maturity and now classified as measured at amortised cost.

In particular, the IAS 39 accounting policies applied in the prior period and IFRS 13 policies relating to the measurement of fair value in both periods are not repeated here, but will need to be presented. This note sets out the significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidat ed financial statements. 1.2.1 Financial assets and liabilities Measurement methods Amortised cost and effective interest rate IFRS9(App A) The amortised cost is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any loss allowance. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset (i.e. its amortised cost before any impairment allowance) or to the amortised cost of a financial liability. The calculation does not consider expected credit losses and includes transaction costs, premiums or discounts and fees and points paid or received that are integral to the effec tive interest rate, such as origination fees. For purchased or originated credit -impaired (‘POCI’) financial assets – assets that are credit -impaired (see definition on note 3.1.2.2) at initial recognition – the Group calculates the credit -adjusted effecti ve interest rate, which is calculated based on the amortised cost of the financial assetinstead of its gross carrying amount and incorporates the impact of expected credit losses in estimated future cash flows. When the Group revises the estimates of fut ure cash flows, the carrying amount of the respective financial assets or financial liability is adjusted to reflect the new estimate discounted using the original effective interest rate. Any chan ges are recognised in profit or loss. Interest income IFRS9(5.4.1) Interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of financial assets , except for: (a) POCI financial assets, for which the original credit -adjusted effective interest rate is applied to the amortised cost of the financial asset. (b) Financial assets that are not ‘POCI’ but have subsequently become credit -impaired (or ‘stage 3’), for which interest revenue is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to their amortised cost (i.e. net of the expect ed credit loss provision). Initial recognition and measurement IFRS9(3.1.1) IFRS9(3.1.2) Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade -date, the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 18 IFRS9(5.1.1) At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset or financial liability at its fair value plus or minus, in the case of a financial asset or financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are incremental and directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability, such as fees and co mmissions. Transaction costs of financial assets and financial liabilities carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss. Immediately after initial recognition, an expected credit loss allowance (ECL) is recognised for financi al assets measured at amortised cost and investments in debt instruments measured at FVOCI, as described in note 3.1.2, which results in an accounting loss being recognised in profit or loss when an asset is newly originated. IFRS 9 (B5.1.2A) When the fai r value of financial assets and liabilities differs from the transaction price on initial recognition, the entity recogn ises the difference as follows: (a) When the fair value is evidenced by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liabili ty (i.e. a Level 1 input) or based on a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, the difference is recognised as a gain or loss. (b) In all other cases, the difference is deferred and the timing of recognition of deferred day one profit or loss is determined individually. It is either amortised over the life of the instrument, deferred until the instrument’s fair value can be determined using market observable inputs, or realised through settlement. 1.2.1.1 Financial assets (i) Class ification and subsequent measurement IFRS9(4.1.1) From 1 January 2018, the Group has applied IFRS 9 and classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories: Fair value through profit or loss (FVPL); Fair value through other comprehensi ve income (FVOCI); or Amortised cost. The classification requirements for debt and equity instruments are described below: Debt instruments Debt instruments are those instruments that meet the definition of a financial liability from the issuer’s perspective, such as loans, government and corporate bonds and trade receivables purchased from clients in factoring arrangements without recourse. IFRS9(5.1.1) Classification and subsequent measurement of debt instruments depend on: (i) the Group’s business mo del for managing the asset ; and (ii) the cash flow characteristics of the asset. Based on these factors, the Group classifies its debt instruments into one of the following three measurement categories: IFRS9(4.1.2) Amortised cost: Assets that are held for co llection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest (‘SPPI’), and that are not designated at FVPL, are measured at amortised cost. The carrying amount of these assets is adjusted by any expected cre dit loss allowance recognised and measured as described in note 3.1.2. Interest income from these financial assets is included in ‘Interest and similar income’ using the effective interest rate method. IFRS9(4.1.2A) Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI): Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the assets, where the assets’ cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, and that are not designated at FVPL, are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). Movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses on the instrument’s amortised cost wh ich are recognised in profit or loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognised in ‘Net Investment income’. Interest income from these financial assets is included in ‘Interest income’ using the effective interest rate method.',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 19 IFRS9(4.1.4) Fair value through profit or loss: Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at fair value through profit or loss. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss and presented in the profit or loss statement within ‘Net trading income’ in th e period in which it arises, unless it arises from debt instruments that were designated at fair value or which are not held for trading, in which case they are presented separately in ‘Net investment income’. Interest income from these financial assets is included in ‘Interest income’ us ing the effective interest rate method. IFRS9 (B4.1.2.A) , (B4.1.2.B) Business model: the business model reflects how the Group manages the assets in order to generate cash flows. That is, whether the Group’s objective is solely to collect the contractual cash flows from the assets or is to collect both the contractual cash flows and cash flows arising from the sale of assets. If neither of these is applicable (e.g. financial assets are held for trading purposes), then the f inancial assets are classified as part of ‘other’ business model and measured at FVPL. Factors considered by the Group in determining the business model for a group of assets include past experience on how the cash flows for these assets were collected, how the asset’s performance is evaluated and reported to key management personnel, how risks are assessed and managed and how managers are compensated. For example, the Group’s business model for the mortgage loan book is to hold to collect contractual cash flows, with sales of loans only being made internally to a consolidated SPV for the purposes of collateralising notes issued, with no resulting derecognition by the Group. Another example is the liquidity portfolio of assets, which is held by the Group as part of liquidity management and is generally classified within the hold to collect and sell business model. Securities held for trading are held principally for the purpose of selling in the near term or are part of a portfolio of financial instruments th at are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short -term profit -taking. These securities are classified in the ‘other’ business model and measured at FVPL. IFRS9 (B4.1.7A) SPPI: Where the business model is to hold a ssets to collect contractual cash flows or to collect contractual cash flows and sell, the Group assesses whether the financial instruments’ cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest (the ‘SPPI test’). In making this assessment, the Gr oup considers whether the contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic lending arrangement i.e. interest includes only consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks and a profit margin that is consistent with a bas ic lending arrangement. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that are inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss. PwC observat ion – Significant accounting judgements in determining business model and applying SPPI test Determining the appropriate business model and assessing whether cash flows generated by an asset constitute solely payments of principal and interest is sometimes complex and may require significant judgement. Depending on the level of judgement and the amount of financial assets affected by the conclusion, the SPPI and/or business model assessment may require disclosure as a significant judgement in accordance wit h paragraph 122 of IAS 1. For example, a judgement on whether or not a contractual clause in all loans of a certain type (e.g. all residential mortgages) breaches SPPI and results in a material portfolio being recorded at FVPL. IFRS9(4.3.2), (4.3.3) Finan cial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest. IFRS9(4.4.1) The Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for m anaging those assets changes. The reclassification takes place from the start of the first reporting period following the change. Such changes are expected to be very infrequent and none occurred during the period.',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 20 IFRS9(4.1.5) Disclosures not illustra ted as not applicable to the Group The following is a possible accounting policy for fair value option for financial assets, which was not included as not used by the Group: Fair value option for financial assets The Group may also irrevocably design ate financial assets at fair value through profit or loss if doing so significantly reduces or eliminates a mismatch created by assets and liabilities being measured on different bases . Equity instruments IAS32R(11) Equity instruments are instruments that meet the definition of equity from the issuer’s perspective ; that is, instruments that do not contain a contractual obligation to pay and that evidence a residual interest in the issuer’s net assets. Examples of equity instruments include basic ordina ry shares. IFRS9(5.7.2) The Group subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value through profit or loss, except where the Group’s management has elected, at initial recognition, to irrevocably designate an equity investment at fair value throu gh other comprehensive income. The Group’s policy is to designate equity investments as FVOCI when those investments are held for purposes other than to generate investment returns. When this election is used , fair value gains and losses are recognised in OCI and are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss, including on disposal. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) are not reported separately from other changes in fair value. Dividends, when representing a return on such investment s, continue to be recognised in profit or loss as other income when the Group’s right to receive payments is established. Gains and losses on equity investments at FVPL are included in the ‘Net trading income’ line in the statement of profit or loss. (ii) Impairment IFRS9(5.5.17) The Group assesses on a forward -looking basis the expected credit losses (‘ECL’) associated with its debt instrument assets carried at amortised cost and FVOCI and with the exposure arising from loan commitments and financial gu arantee contracts. The Group recognises a loss allowance for such losses at each reporting date. The measurement of ECL reflects: An unbiased and probability -weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes; The time value of m oney; and Reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. Note 3.1.2 provides more detail of how the expected cre dit loss allowance is measured. (iii) Modification of loans IFRS9(5.4.3) The Group sometimes renegotiates or otherwise modifies the contractual cash flows of loans to customers. When this happens, the Group assesses whether or not the new terms are substantially different to the original terms. The Group does this by considering, among others, the following factors: If the borrower is in financial difficulty, whether the modification merely reduces the contractual cash flows to amounts the borrower is e xpected to be able to pay. Whether any substantial new terms are introduced, such as a profit share /equity -based return that substantially affects the risk profile of the loan. Significant extension of the loan term when the borrower is not in financial di fficulty. Significant change in the interest rate. Change in the currency the loan is denominated in. Insertion of collateral, other security or credit enhancements that significantly affect the credit risk associated with the loan.',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 21 IFRS9(B5.5.25 ), (B5.5. 26) If the terms are substantially different, the Group derecognises the original financial asset and recognises a ‘new’ asset at fair value and recalculates a new effective interest rate for the asset. The date of renegotiation is consequently considered to be the date of initial recognition for impairment calculation purposes, including for the purpose of determining whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred. However, the Group also assesses whether the new financial asset recognised is deemed to be credit -impaired at initial recognition, especially in circumstances where the renegotiation was driven by the debtor being unable to make the originally agreed payments. Differences in the carrying amount are also recognised in profit or loss as a gain or loss on derecognition. IFRS9(5.4.3) If the terms are not substantially different, the renegotiation or modification does not result in derecognition, and the Group recalculates the gross carrying amount based on the revised cash flows of the financial asset and recognises a modification gain or loss in profit or loss. The new gross carrying amount is recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original effective interest rate (or credit -adjusted effective interest rate for purch ased or originated credit -impaired financial assets). The impact of modifications of financial assets on the expected credit loss c alculation is discussed in note 3.1.5. PwC observation – Derecognition of revolving products The derecognition assessment for revolving products, such as credit cards and overdrafts, is a complex area which requires significant judgement in applying the IFRS 9 requirements. Therefore, additional disclosures would be expected about the accounting policies applied to such prod ucts where these are relevant to the entity. (iv) Derecognition other than on a modification IFRS9(3.2.3) Financial assets, or a portion thereof, are derecognised when the contractual rights to receive the cash flows from the assets have expired, or whe n they have been transferred and either (i) the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, or (ii) the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and the Group has not retained contro l. IFRS9(3.2.5) The Group enters into transactions where it retains the contractual rights to receive cash flows from assets but assumes a contractual obligation to pay those cash flows to other entities and transfers substantially all of the risks and re wards. These transactions are accounted for as ‘pass through’ transfers that result in derecognition if the Group: (i) Has no obligation to make payments unless it colle cts equivalent amounts from the assets; (ii) Is prohibited from selling or pledging the assets; and (iii) Has an obligation to remit any cash it collects from the assets without material delay. Collateral (shares and bonds) furnished by the Group under standard repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions are not derecognised b ecause the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards on the basis of the predetermined repurchase price, and the criteria for derecognition are therefore not met. This also applies to certain securitisation transactions in which the Group retai ns a subordinated residual interest. 1.2.1. 2 Financial liabilities (i) Classification and subsequent measurement IFRS9(4.2.1) IFRS9(B5.7.16) In both the current and prior period, financial liabilities are classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost, except for: Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss: this classification is applied to derivatives, financial liabilities held for trading (e.g. short positions in the trading booking) and other financial liabilities designated as such at initial recognition. Gains or losses on financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss are presented partially in other comprehensive income (the amount of change in the fair value of the financial liability that is attributable t o changes in the credit risk of that liability, which is determined as the amount that is not attributable to changes in market conditions that give rise to market risk) and partially profit or loss (the remaining amount of change in the fair value of the liability). This is unless such a presentation would create, or enlarge, an accounting mismatch, in',\n",

In subsequent periods, the Group recognises any expense incurred on the financia l liability; and Financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments (see note 1.3). (ii) Derecognition IFRS9(3.3.1) Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished (i.e. when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, canc elled or expires). IFRS9(3.3.2), (3.3.3), (B3.3.6) The exchange between the Group and its original lenders of debt instruments with substantially different terms, as well as substantial modifications of the terms of existing financial liabilities, are acc ounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. The terms are substantially different if the discounted present value of the cash flows under the new terms, including any fees paid net o f any fees received and discounted using the original effective interest rate, is at least 10% different from the discounted present value of the remaining cash flows of the original financial liability. In addition, other qualitative factors, such as the currency that the instrument is denominated in, changes in the type of interest rate, new conversion features attached to the instrument and change in covenants are also taken into consideration. If an exchange of debt instruments or modification of terms is accounted for as an extinguishment, any costs or fees incurred are recognised as part of the gain or loss on the extinguishment. If the exchange or modification is not accounted for as an extinguishment, any costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying am ount of the liability and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified liability. 1.2.2 Financial guarantee contracts and loan commitments IFRS9 (Appendix A) Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due, in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Such financial guarantees are given to banks, financial institutions and others on behalf o f customers to secure loans, overdrafts and other banking facilities. IFRS9(4.2.1) Financial guarantee contracts are initially measured at fair value and subs equently measured at the higher of: The amount of the loss allowance (calculated as described in note 3.1.2) ; and The premium received on initial recognition less income recognised in accordance with the prin ciples of IFRS 15. IFRS9(2.3) Loan commitments provided by the Group are measured as the amount of the loss allowance (calculated as described i n note 3.1.2). The Group has not provided any c ommitment to provide loans at a below -market interest rate, or that can be settled net in cash or by deliveri ng or issuing another financial instrument. IFRS7(B8E) For loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts, the loss allowance is recognised as a provision. However, for contracts that include both a loan and an undrawn commitment and the Group cannot separately identify the expected credit losses on the undrawn commitment component from those on the loan component, the expected credit losses on the undrawn commitment are recognised together with the loss allowance for the loan. To the extent that the combined expected credit losses exceed the gross carrying amount of the loan, the expected credit los ses are recognised as a provision. 1.2.3 Derivatives and hedging activities IFRS9(7.2.21) The Group has elected to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 on adoption of IFRS 9. IFRS7(44Z) The Group has not provided comparative in formation for periods before the date of initial application of IFRS 9 for the new disclosures introduced by IFRS 9 as a consequential amendment to IFRS 7, as permitted by IFRS 7 paragraph 44Z.',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 23 Disclosures not illustrated as not applicable to the Group For the purposes of these Illustrative financial statements, the Group has not adopted the new hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9. Nevertheless, the rev ised hedge accounting disclosures introduced by the consequential amendments to IFRS 7 are applicabl e whether or not an entity has adopted the hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9 and are therefore illustrated in note 4. Where banks choose to adopt the new hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9, they will need to disclose different accounting policie s along with an explanation of the resulting impacts. IFRS9(4.1.4), (4.2.1a) Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. All derivatives are carried as assets when fair value is positive and as liabilities when fair value is negative. IFRS9(4.3.2) IFRS9(4.3.3) Certain derivatives are embedded in hybrid contracts, such as the conversion option in a convertible bond. If the hybrid contract cont ains a host that is a financial asset, then the Group assesses the entire contract as described in the financial assets section above for classification and measurement purposes. Otherwise, the embedded derivatives are treated as separate derivatives when: (i) Their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract; (ii) A separate instrument with the same terms would meet the definition of a derivative ; and (iii) The hybrid contract is not measured at fair value through profit or lo ss. These embedded derivatives are separately accounted for at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit or loss unless the Group chooses to designate the hybrid contracts at fair value through profit or loss. IAS39p86 The method of recognising the resulting fair value gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated and qualifies as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as either: (a) Hedg es of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or firm commitments (fair value hedges); (b) Hedges of highly probable future cash flows attributable to a recognised asset or liability (cash flow hedges); or (c) Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedges). IAS39p88 The Group documents, at the inception of the hedge, the relationship between hedged items and hedging instruments, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transaction s. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. IAS39p89 (a) Fair value hedge Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the statement of profit or loss, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are a ttribu table to the hedged risk. IAS39p92 If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to profit or loss over the period to maturity and r ecorded as net interest income.',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 24 IAS39p95 (b) Cash flow hedge IAS39p95 IAS39p100, IAS39p101 The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensi ve income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss. Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled to the statement of profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss. They are recorded in the income or expense lines in which the revenue or expense associated with the related hedged item is reported. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accountin g, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur (for example, the recognised hedged as set is disposed of ), the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is immediately reclassified to the statement of profit or loss. IAS39p102 (c) Net investment hedge Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are a ccounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised directly in other comprehensive income; the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised i mmediately in the statement of profit or loss. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the statement of profit or loss when the foreign operation is disposed of as part of the gain or loss on the disposal. 2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements IAS1(122), (125) The preparation of financial statements requires the use of accounting estimates which, by definition, will seldom equal the actual results. Management also needs to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting poli cies. This note provides an overview of the areas that involve a higher degree of judgement or complexity, and major sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment within the next financial year. Deta iled information about each of these estimates and judgements is included in the related notes together with information about the basis of calculation for each affected line item in the financial statements. Measurement of the expected credit loss allow ance The measurement of the expected credit loss allowance for financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI is an area that requires the use of complex models and significant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit behaviour (e.g . the likelihood of customers defaulting and the resulting losses). Explanation of the inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques used in measuring ECL is further detailed in note 3.1.2.3, which also sets out key sensitivities of the ECL to changes in these elements. A number of significant judgements are also required in applying the accounting requirements for measuring ECL, such as: Determining criteria for significant increase in credit risk; Choosing appropriate models and assumptions for the measur ement of ECL; Establishing the number and relative weighting s of forward -looking scenarios for each type of product/market and the associated ECL; and Establishing groups of similar financial assets for the purposes of measuring ECL. Detailed information about the judgements and estimates made by the Group in the above areas is set out in note 3.1.2.',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 25 PwC observation Significant judgements in measuring ECL Not all the significant judgements listed above may be relevant to all Banks. Conversely, judgements not listed above may be significant for some Banks, for example determining the relevant period of exposure to credit risk when measuring ECL for credit cards and revolving credit facilities. The disclosure provided should, therefore, be tailored appropriately. Business models and SPPI as significant judgments As well as ECL, determining the appropriate business models and assessing the SPPI requirements for financial assets may require significant accounting judgement and have a significant impact on the financia l statements, as discussed in note 1.2.1.1(i). When this is the case, these judgements should also be disclosed or cross -referenced in this section. 3. Financial risk management PwC observation – Comparative disclosures IFRS 9 introduced and modified se veral disclosure requirements in IFRS 7 in relation to credit risk and impairment of financial instruments. These new disclosures are not required to be provided for the comparative period if a bank chooses not to restate the prior period in accordance wit h the exemption provided in IFRS 9 paragraph 7.2.15. Consequently, all disclosures required by the previous version of IFRS 7 should be provided in respect of the comparative period. Such disclosures have not been illustrated in this document. The follow ing section discusses the Group’s risk management policies. The measurement of ECL under IFRS 9 uses the information and approaches that the Group uses to manage credit risk, though certain adjustments are made in order to comply with the requirements of I FRS 9. The approach taken for IFRS 9 measurement purposes is discussed separately in note 3.1.2. 3.1 Credit risk IFRS7(33)(a) Credit risk is the risk of suffering financial loss, should any of the Group’s customers, clients or market counterparties fail to fulfil their contractual obligations to the Group. Credit risk arises mainly from interbank, commercial and consumer loans and advances, and loan commitments arising from such lending activities, but can also arise from credit enhancement provided, suc h as credit derivatives ( credit default swaps), financial guarantees, letters of credit, endorsements and acceptances. The Group is also exposed to other credit risks arising from investments in debt securities and other exposures arising from its trading activities (‘trading exposures’) including non -equity trading portfolio assets and derivatives as well as settlement balances with market counte rparties and reverse repurchase agreements. Credit risk is the single largest risk for the Group’s business; man agement therefore carefully manages its exposure to credit risk. The credit risk management and control are centralised in a credit risk management team which reports regularly to the Board of Directors and head of each business unit. IFRS7 (33)(b) 3.1.1 Credit risk measurement (a) Loans and advances ( incl. loan commitments and guarantees) The estimation of credit exposure for risk management purposes is complex and requires the use of models, as the exposure varies with changes in market conditions, e xpected cash flows and the passage of time. The assessment of credit risk of a portfolio of assets entails further estimations as to the likelihood of defaults occurring, of the associated loss ratios and of default correlations between counterparties. The Group measures credit risk using Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD) and Loss Given Default (LGD). This is similar to the approach used for the purposes of measuring Expected Credit Loss (ECL) under IFRS 9. Refer to note 3.1.2 for more details.',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 26 Credit risk grading The Group uses internal credit risk gradings that reflect its assessment of the probability of default of individual counterparties. The Group use internal rating models tailored to the various categories of counterparty . Borrower and loan specific information collected at the time of application (such as disposable income, and level of collateral for retail exposures; and turnover and industry type for wholesale exposures) is fed into this rating model. This is supplemented w ith external data such as credit bureau scoring information on individual borrowers. In addition, the models enable expert judgement from the Credit Risk Officer to be fed into the final internal credit rating for each exposure. This allows for considerati ons which may not be captured as part of the other data inputs into the model. The credit grades are calibrated such that the risk of default increases exponentially at each higher risk grade. For example, this means that the difference in the PD between a n A and A - rating grade is lower than the difference in the PD between a B and B - rating grade. The following are additional considerations for each type of portfolio held by the Group: Retail After the date of initial recognition, for retail business, the payment behaviour of the borrower is monitored on a periodic basis to develop a behavioural score. Any other known information about the borrower which impact s their creditworthiness – Such as unemployment and previous delinquency history – is also incorp orated into the behavioural score. This score is mapped to a PD. Wholesale For wholesale business, the rating is determined at the borrower level. A relationship manager will incorporate any updated or new information/credit assessments into the credit sys tem on an ongoing basis. In addition, the relationship manager will also update information about the creditworthiness of the borrower every year from sources such as public financial statements. This will determine the updated internal credit rating and P D. Treasury For debt securities in the Treasury portfolio, external rating agency credit grades are used. These published grades are continuously monitored and updated. The PD’s associated with each grade are determined based on realised default rates over the prior 12 months, as published by the rating agency. The Group’s rating method comprises 25 rating levels for instruments not in default (1 to 25) and five default classes (26 to 30). The master scale assigns each rating category a specified range of p robabilities of default, which is stable over time. The rating methods are subject to an annual validation and recalibration so that they reflect the latest projections in the light of all actually observed defaults.',\n",

It has been included as it provides useful information to users of the financial statements in understanding the entity’s risk management practices and evaluating the nature of risks arising from financi al instruments in line wit h the disclosure objective in paragraph 31 of IFRS 7. 3.1.2 Expected credit loss measurement IFRS 9 outlines a ‘three -stage’ model for impairment based on changes in credit quality since initial recognition as summarised below: A financial instrument that is not credit -impaired on initial recognition is classified in ‘Stage 1’ and has its credit risk continuously monitored by the Group. If a significant increase in credit risk (‘SICR’) since initial recognition is identified, the financial instrument is moved to ‘Stage 2’ but is not yet deemed to be credit -impaired. Please refer to note 3.1.2.1 for a description of how the Group determines when a significant increase in credit risk has occurred. If the financial instrument is credit -impaired, the financial inst rument is then moved to ‘Stage 3’. Please refer to note 3.1.2.2 for a description of how the Group defines credit -impaired and default. Financial instruments in Stage 1 have their ECL measured at an amount equal to the portion of lifetime expected credit l osses that result from default events possible within the next 12 months. Instruments in Stages 2 or 3 have their ECL measured based on expected credit losses on a lifetime basis. Please refer to note 3.1.2.3 for a description of inputs, assumptions and es timation techniques used in measuring the ECL. A pervasive concept in measuring ECL in accordance with IFRS 9 is that it should consider forward - looking information. Note 3.1.2.4 includes an explanation of how the Group has incorporated this in its ECL mod els. Purchased or originated credit -impaired financial assets are those financial assets that are credit - impaired on initial recognition. Their ECL is always measured on a lifetime basis (Stage 3). Further explanation is also provided of how the Group dete rmines appropriate groupings when ECL is measured on a collective basis (refer to note 3.1.2.5). The following diagram summarises the impairment requirements under IFRS 9 (other than purchased or originated credit -impaired financial assets): Change in c redit quality since initial recognition Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 (Initial recognition) (Significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition) (Credit -impaired assets) 12-month expected credit losses Lifetime expected credit losses Lifetim e expected credit losses The key judgements and assumptions adopted by the Group in addressing the requirements of the standard are discussed below:',\n",

If at the current reporting date the lifetime PD is actually [Z]% and this exceeds the expected PD of [Y]% by more than the threshold shown above, then a significant increase in credit risk has occurred.',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 30 These thresholds have been determined separately for Retail Mortgages, Other retail products and Wholesale, by assessing how the Lifetime PD moves prior to an instrument becoming delinquent. The Lifetime PD movements on instruments which do not subsequently become delinquent have also been assessed, to identify the “natural” movement in Lifetime PD which is not considered indicative of a significant increase in credit risk. IFRS7(35G)(a)(ii) Qualitati ve criteria: For Retail portfolios, if the borrower meets one or more of the following criteria: In short -term forbearance Direct debit cancellation Extension to the terms granted Previous arrears within the last [12] months For Wholesale and Treasury port folios, if the borrower is on the Watchlist and/or the instrument meets one or more of the following criteria: Significant increase in credit spread Significant adverse changes in business, financial and/or economic c onditions in which the borrower operate s Actual or expected forbearance or restructuring Actual or expected significant adverse change in operating results of the borrower Significant change in collateral value (secured facilities only) which is expected to increase risk of default Early signs of cashflow /liquidity problems such as delay in servicing of trade creditors/loans The assessment of SICR incorporates forward -looking information (refer to note 3.1.2.4 for further information) and is performed on a quarterly basis at a portfolio level fo r all Retail financial instruments held by the Group. In relation to Wholesale and Treasury financial instruments, where a Watchlist is used to monitor credit risk, this assessment is performed at the counterparty level and on a periodic basis. The criteri a used to identify SICR are monitored and reviewed periodically for appropriateness by the independent Credit Risk team. PwC observation – Disclosure of SICR criteria In the illustrative disclosure presented above, consistent criteria have been applied t o each of Retail Mortgages, Other retail products and Wholesale.

Qualitative criteria The borrower meets unlikeliness to pay criteria, which indicates the borrower is in significant financial difficulty. These are instances where: The borrower is in long-term forbearance The borrower is deceased The borrower is insolvent The borrower is in breach of financial covenant(s) An active market for that financial asset has disappeared because of financial difficulties Concessions have been made by the lender relating to the borrower’s financial difficulty It is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy',\n",

The criteria above have been applied to all financial instruments held by the Group and are consistent with the definition of default used for internal credit risk management purposes. The default definition has been applied consistently to model the Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD) and Loss given Default (LGD) throughout the Group’s expected loss calculations . IFRS7(B8A)(b) The 180 days past due default definition used for prime retail mortgages has been aligned with the definition u sed for regulatory capital purposes. Furthermore, the Group performed an analysis which shows that the cure rate (the proportion of instruments which would have moved out of default back to Stage 2 or Stage 1) after 90 days past due is [X]% (compared to [Y ]% after 180 days past due) and therefore 90 days past due is not considered an appropriate default definition. Therefore, the Group considers 180 days past due to be a more appropriate default definition and has rebutted the 90 days past due presumption u nder IFRS 9 for the prime retail mortgage portfolio. This rebuttal will be monitored and reviewed by the Credit Risk department on an annual basis to ensure it remains appropriate. IFRS7(B8A)(c) An instrument is considered to no longer be in default (i.e. to have cured) when it no longer meets any of the default criteria for a consecutive period of six months. This period of six months has been determined based on an analysis which considers the likelihood of a financial instrument returning to default sta tus after cure using different possible cure definitions. IFRS7(35G)(a) 3.1.2.3 Measuring ECL – Explanation of inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques The Expected Credit Loss (ECL) is measured on either a 12 -month (12M) or Lifetime basis dependin g on whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred since initial recognition or whether an asset is considered to be credit -impaired. Expected credit losses are the discounted product of the Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EA D), and Loss Given Default (LGD), defined as follows: The PD represents the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on its financial obligation (as per “Definition of default and credit -impaired ” above), either over the next 12 months (12M PD), or over the remaining lifetime (Lifetime PD) of the obligation. EAD is based on the amounts the Group expects to be owed at the time of default, over the next 12 months (12M EAD) or over the remaining lifetime (Lifetime EAD). For example, for a revolving commitment, the Group includes the current drawn balance plus any further amount that is expected to be drawn up to the current contractual limit by the time of default, should it occur. Loss Given Default (LGD) represents the Group’s expectation of the extent of loss on a defaulted exposure. LGD varies by type of counterparty, type and seniority of claim and availability of collateral or other credit support. LGD is expressed as a percentage loss per unit of exposure at the time of default (EAD). LGD is calculated on a 12 -month or lifetime basis, where 12-month LGD is the percentage of loss expected to be made if the default occurs in the next 12 months and Lifetime LGD is the percentage of loss expected to be made if the default occurs over the remaining expected lifetime of the loan. The ECL is determined by projecting the PD, LGD and EAD for each future month and for each individual exposure or collective segment. These three components are multiplied together and adjusted for the likelihood of survival (i.e. the exposur e has not prepaid or defaulted in an earlier month). This effectively calculates an ECL for each future month, which is then discounted back to the reporting date and summed. The discount rate used in the ECL calculation is the original effective interest rate or an approximation thereof . IFRS7(35G)(a)(i) The Lifetime PD is developed by applying a maturity profile to the current 12M PD. The maturity profile looks at how defaults develop on a portfolio from the point of initial recognition throughout the li fetime of the loans. The maturity profile is based on historical observed data and is assumed to be the same across all assets within a portfolio and credit grade band. This is supported by historical analysis. The 12 -month and lifetime EADs are determin ed based on the expected payment profile , which varies by product type.',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 33 For amortising products and bullet repayment loans, this is based on the contractual repayments owed by the borrower over a 12month or lifetime basis. This will also be adjusted for an y expected overpayments made by a borrower. Early repayment/refinance assumptions are also incorporated into the calculation . For revolving products, the exposure at default is predicted by taking current drawn balance and adding a “credit conversion facto r” which allows for the expected drawdown of the remaining limit by the time of default. These assumptions vary by product type and current limit utilisation band, based on analysis of the Group’s recent default data. The 12 -month and lifetime LGDs are det ermined based on the factors which impact the recoveries made post defau lt. These vary by product type. For secured products, this is primarily based on collateral type and projected collateral values, historical discounts to market/book values due to forc ed sales, time to repossession and recovery costs observed. For unsecured products, LGD’s are typically set at product level due to the limited differentiation in recoveries achieved across different borrowers. These LGD’s are influenced by collection stra tegies, including contracted debt sales and price. Forward -looking economic information is also included in determining the 12 -month and lifetime PD, EAD and LGD. These assumptions vary by product type. Refer to note 3.1.2.4 for an explanation of forwar d- looking information and its inclusion in ECL calculations. The assumptions underlying the ECL calculation – such as how the maturity profile of the PDs and how collateral values change etc. – are monitored and reviewed on a quarterly basis. IFRS7(35G) (c) There have been no significant changes in estimation techniques or significant assumptions made during the reporting period. IFRS7(35G)(b) 3.1.2.4 F orward -looking information incorporated in the ECL models The assessment of SICR and the calculation of ECL both incorporate forward -looking information. The Group has performed historical analysis and identified the key economic variables impacting credit risk and expected credit losses for each portfolio. These economic variables and their associated im pact on the PD, EAD and LGD vary by financial instrument. Expert judgment has also been applied in this process. Forecasts of these economic variables (the “base economic scenario ”) are provided by the Group’s Economics team on a quarterly basis and provid e the best estimate view of the economy over the next five years. After five years, to project the economic variables out for the full remaining lifetime of each instrument, a mean reversion approach has been used, which means that economic variables tend to either a long run average rate (e.g. for unemployment) or a long run average growth rate (e.g. GDP) over a period of two to five years. The impact of these economic variables on the PD, EAD and LGD has been determined by performing statistical regressio n analysis to understand the impact changes in these variables have had historically on default rates a nd on the components of LGD and EAD. In addition to the base economic scenario, the Group’s Economics team also provide other possible scenarios along wi th scenario weightings . The number of other scenarios used is set based on the analysis of each major product type to ensure non -linearities are captured. The number of scenarios and their attributes are reassessed at e ach reporting date. At 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2018, for all but two portfolios the Group concluded that three scenarios appropriately captured non -linearities. For portfolios [X] and [Y], the Group concluded that two additional downside scenarios w ere required. The scenario weighting s are determined by a combination of statistical analysis and expert credit judgement , taking account of the range of possible outcomes each chosen scenario is representative of . The assessment of SICR is performed using the Lifetime PD under each of the base , and the other scenarios, multiplied by the associated scenario weighting , along with qualitative and backstop indicators (see note 3.1.2.1). This determines whether the whole financial instrument is in Stage 1, Stage 2, or Stage 3 and hence whether 12 -month or lifetime ECL should be recorded. Following this assessment, the Group measures ECL as either a probability weighted 12 month ECL (Stage 1), or a probability weighted lifetime ECL (Stage s 2 and 3). These probability -weighted ECLs are determined by running',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 34 each scenario through the relevant ECL model and multiplying it by the appropriate scenario weighting (as opposed to weighting the inputs). As with any economic forecasts, the projections and likelihoods of occurrence are subject to a high degree of inherent uncertainty and therefore the actual outcomes may be significantly different to those projected. The Group considers these forecasts to represent its best estimate of the possible outcomes and has analysed the non -linearities and asymmetries within the Group’s different portfolios to establish that the chosen scenarios are appropr iately representative of the range of possible scenarios.

PwC observation – Different geographies, number of forward -looking macro -economic scenarios and use of management “overlays ” Banks should consider how the illustrative disclosu res above should be adapted to take account of their own particular circumstances, for example to cover different geographies and/or different assumptions which may also be relevant. For illustrative purposes only, the same three forward -looking macroecon omic scenarios have been considered appropriate for all but two of the portfolios held by the Group. In practice, Banks will have to determine for each material portfolio both the appropriate number of scenarios to be used and what those scenarios should b e, taking account of the types of products, geographies etc. to which they are exposed and the resulting nonlinearities and potential losses. In the above illustrative disclosure, management has concluded that no additional provision or “overlay ” is requir ed for regulatory, legislative or political changes. However, where major events occur close to the reporting date, so that the potential effects are not appropriately captured in models and inputs, this may well be a key area of judgement that also requir es greater disclosure. More recent examples of such events include the UK “Brexit ” vote to leave the EU. Sensitivity analysis IAS1(129) The most significant assumptions affecting the ECL allowance are as follows: Retail portfolios (i) House price index, given the significant impact it has on mortgage collateral valuations; and (ii) Unemployment rate, given its impact on secured and unsecured borrowers’ ability to meet their contractual repayments. Wholesale portfolios (i) GDP, given the significant impact on companie s’ perform ance and collateral valuations; and (ii) Interest rate, given its impact on companies’ likelihood of default. Set out below are the changes to the ECL as at 31 December 2018 that would result from reasonably possible changes in these parameters from the actual assumptions used in the Group’s economic variable assumptions (for example, the impact on ECL of increasing the estimat ed unemployment rate by [X]% in each of the base, upside, downside, downside 2 and downside 3 scenarios):',\n",

The disclosure above represents on e way of meeting the disclosures required by IAS 1 paragraphs 125 and 129. Banks should also consider, as applicable, the expectations and guidance provided by different national regulators and other international bodies, such as the Financial Stability Bo ard’s Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF). Furthermore, Banks should also consider the appropriate level of granularity for these disclosures, which may vary depending on the characteristics of their different portfolios and which elements of the ECL cal culation have the greatest impact.

Providing these disclosures in the same tabl e avoids duplication of information, as often the gross carrying amount also represents the maximum exposure to credit risk on financial instruments subject to IFRS 9 impairment requirements. However, the disclosure in paragraph 35K of IFRS 7 should be pro vided by each class of financial instrument, including loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts when material. IFRS 7 paragraph 6 requires grouping of financial instruments into classes that are appropriate to the nature of the information disclo sed and that take into account the characteristics of those financial instruments. The level at which ‘class’ is defined can vary across different disclosure requirements. Therefore, judgement should be applied in determining the classes of financial instrument to be disclosed, which will often be on a more granular level than the balance sheet line items. IFRS7(35N) IFRS7(B8J) Disclosure not illustrated as not applicable to the Group When the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9 paragraph 5.5.15 is us ed to calculate the ECL of trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivable, the balances for such financial assets should be separately disclosed in an additional column in the table above. Alternatively, the information provided for these assets m ay be based on a provision matrix. When an entity has measured expected credit losses on a collective basis, it may not be able to allocate the gross carrying amount of individual financial instruments to the credit risk rating grades for which lifetime ex pected credit losses are recognised.

The most common of these is accepting collateral for funds advanced. The Group has internal policies on the acceptability of specific classes of collat eral or credit risk mitigation. The Group prepares a valuation of the collateral obtained as part of the loan origination process. This assessment is reviewed periodically . The principal collateral types for loans and advances are: Mortgages over residential properties; Margin agreement for derivatives, for which the Group has also entered into master netting agreements; Charges over business assets such as premises, inventory and accounts receivable; and Charges over financial instruments such as debt securities and equities. Longer -term finance and lending to corporate entities are generally secured; revolving individual credit facilities are generally unsecured. Collateral held as securi ty for financial assets other than loans and advances depends on the nature of the instrument. Debt securities, treasury and other eligible bills are generally unsecured, with the exception of asset -backed securities and similar instruments, which are secu red by portfolios of financial instruments. Derivatives are also collateralised .

Banks should also consider whether there are other material causes of movement that should be shown separately. These might, for example, be shown in the analysis prepared internally for senior management. Additiona l rows may also be required to explain ECL movements for different types of products.

Banks should also consider disclosing whether ECL moveme nts from transfers between stages are measured at the beginning or the end of the reporting periods. 2 When applicable, separate presentation (for example, in an additional column) is also required for trade receivables, contract assets or lease receivables for which loss allowances are measured in accordance with paragraph 5.5.15 of IFRS 9 using the ‘simplified’ approach. 3 The loss allowance for financial assets measured at fair value through OCI shall not be presented separately in the statement of financial position as a reduction of the carrying amount of the financial asset, but should be disclosed in the notes. 4 The reconciliation presented above splits items between those that impact P&L and those that do not. This is not an explicit requirement of IFRS 7 paragraph 35H, however this information is likely to be helpful to users in understanding the impact of the various movements in ECL allowance. IFRS7(35I) Significant changes in the gross carrying amount of financial assets that contributed to changes i n the loss allowance were as follows: The high volume of new mortgages loans originat ed during the period, aligned with the Group’s organic growth objective, increased the gross carrying amount of the mortgage book by 13%, with a corresponding CU 18 increa se in loss allowance measured on a 12 -month basis. The modification of mortgage contracts following renegotiation with customers facing financial difficulties resulted in a reduction of CU 61,000 in the gross carrying amount of Stage 3 mortgages. This also resulted in the reversal of CU 36,000 of Stage 3 loss allowance. Also refer to note 3.1.6. The write -off of mortgage loans with a total gross carrying amount of CU 57,000 resulted in the reduction of the Stage 3 loss allowance by the same amount. IFRS7(3 5I) The following table further explains changes in the gross carrying amount of the mortgage portfolio to help explain their significance to the changes in the loss allowance for the same portfolio as discussed above: Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Purchased credit - impaired Total Retail Mortgages 12- month ECL Lifetime ECL Lifetime ECL CU’000 CU’000 CU’000 CU’000 CU’000 Gross carrying amount as at 1 January 2018 54,475 1,537 1,309 72 57,393 Transfers: Transfer from Stage 1 to Stage 2 (1,345) 1,345 – – – Transfer from Stage 1 to Stage 3 (120) – 120 – – Transfer from Stage 2 to Stage 3 – (166) 166 – – Transfer from Stage 3 to Stage 2 – 3 (3) – – Transfer from Stage 2 to Stage 1 33 (33) – – – Financial assets derecognised during the period other than write -offs (4,862) (166) (28) – (5,056) New financial assets originated or purchased 7,619 – – 6 7,625 Modification of contractual cash flows of financial assets – – (61) – (61) Changes in interest accrual 2,233 64 33 – 2,330 Write -offs – – (57) – (57) FX and other movements 109 7 – – 116 Gross carrying amount as at 31 December 2018 58,142 2,591 1,479 78 62,290 [The disclosures above should be repeated for each class of financial instrument, but are omitted here for illustrative purposes].',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 44 PwC observation – Reconciliation of gross carrying amount IFRS 7 paragraph 35I does not explicitly require the gross carrying amount of financial instruments to be reconciled. However, a reconciliation table, in addition to narrative disclosures, is includ ed in IFRS 7 paragraph IG20B as an illustration of how the information required by that paragraph can be provided. In our view, including such a reconciliation table will typically be the most helpful way of meeting these disclosure requirements. Movement descriptions in this table may need to be amended based on product types (e.g. a specific line for ‘additional drawings’ on existing drawn facilities). If included, this table should also be provided for each class of financial instrument. IFRS7(35H)(c) The total amount of undiscounted expected credit losses at initial recognition for purchased or originated credit -impaired financial assets recognised during the period was CU 10,000. 3.1.5 Write -off policy IFRS7(35F)(e) The Group writes off financial a ssets, in whole or in part, when it has exhausted all practical recovery efforts and has concluded there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include (i) ceasing enforcement activity and (ii) where the Group’s recovery method is foreclosing on collateral and the value of the collateral is such that there is no reasonable expectation of recovering in full. IFRS7(35F)(e) IFRS7(35L) The Group may write -off financial assets that are still subj ect to enforcement activity. The outstanding contractual amounts of such assets written off during the year ended 31 December 2018 was CU 41,000. The Group still seeks to recover amounts it is legally owed in full, but which have been partially written off due to no reasonable expectation of full recovery. 3.1.6 Modification of financial assets The Group sometimes modifies the terms of loans provided to customers due to commercial renegotiations, or for distressed loans, with a view to maximising recove ry. Such restructuring activities include extended payment term arrangements, payment holidays and payment forgiveness. Restructuring policies and practices are based on indicators or criteria which, in the judgement of management, indicate that payment will most likely continue. These policies are kept under continuous review. Restructuring is most commonly applied to term loans. IFRS7(35F)(f)(i) IFRS7(35J)(b) The risk of default of such assets after modification is assessed at the reporting date and co mpared with the risk under the original terms at initial recognition, when the modification is not substantial and so does not result in derecognition of the original asset (refer to notes 1.2.1.1(iv) and (v) above). The Group monitors the subsequent perfo rmance of modified assets. The Group may determine that the credit risk has significantly improved after restructuring, so that the assets are moved from Stage 3 or Stage 2 (Lifetime ECL) to Stage 1 (12 -month ECL). This is only the case for assets which ha ve performed in accordance with the new terms for six consecutive months or more . The gross carrying amount of such assets held as at 31 December 2018 was CU 41,000. IFRS7(35F)(f)(ii) The Group continues to monitor if there is a subsequent significant in crease in credit risk in relation to such assets through the use of specific models for modified assets. IFRS7(35J)(a) The following table includes summary information for financial assets with lifetime ECL whose cash flows were modified during the period as part of the Group’s restructuring activities and their respective effect on the Group’s financial performance: Loans and advance to customers CU’000 Amortised cost before modification 234 Net modification (loss) (61)',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 45 PwC observation – Voluntary disclosure of net impact in P&L from modifications The overall profit or loss impact of modifications will often be less than the net gain/(loss) disclosed above, which excludes the impact of any offsetting release of ECL allowances. W hile not required by IFRS 7, Banks may, therefore, wish to explain this, with disclosure such as: ‘The net modification loss above represents the changes in the gross carrying amounts (i.e. before impairment allowance) of the financial assets from immediat ely before, to immediately after, modification. In the significant majority of cases, this gross loss had been anticipated and already materially reflected within the ECL allowance. The impact of modification on the ECL allowances associated with these ass ets was a release of ECL allowances of CU[X]. The net impact on the statement of profit or loss for the period was, therefore, CU[X].’ 4. Hedge accounting disclosures The Group applies hedge accounting in three separate hedging strategies, as follows: Interest rate risk on fixed rate mortgages (fair value hedge) IFRS7(22A)(a), (22B)(a) The Group holds a portfolio of long-term fixed rate mortgages and therefore is exposed to changes in fair value due to movements in market interest rates. The Group man ages this risk exposure by entering into pay fixed /receive floating interest rate swaps. IFRS7( 22A)(b), (22B)(b), (22C) Only the interest rate risk element is hedged and therefore other risks, such as credit risk, are managed but not hedged by the Group. The interest rate risk component is determined as the change in fair value of the long -term fixed rate mortgages arising solely from changes in 3 -month LIBOR (the benchmark rate of interest). Such changes are usually the largest component of the overall c hange in fair value. This strategy is designated as a fair value hedge and its effectiveness is assessed by comparing changes in the fair value of the loans attributable to changes in the benchmark rate of interest with changes in the fair value of the int erest rate swaps. IFRS7 (22B)(c), (23D) The Group establishes the hedging ratio by matching the notional of the derivatives with the principal of the portfolio being hedged. Possible sources of ineffectiveness are as follows: (i) differences between the expect ed and actual volume of prepayments, as the Group hedges to the expected repayment date taking into account expected prepayments based on past experience; (ii) difference in the discounting between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, as cash collaterali sed interest rate swaps are discounted using Overnight Indexed Swaps (OIS) discount curves, which are not applied to the fixed rate mortgages; (iii) hedging derivatives with a non -zero fair value at the date of initial designation as a hedging instrument; and (iv) counterparty credit risk which impacts the fair value of uncollateralised interest rate swaps but not the hedged items. IFRS7( 23C) The Group manages the interest rate risk arising from fixed rate mortgages by entering into interest rate swaps on a monthly b asis. The exposure from this portfolio frequently changes due to new loans originated, contractual repayments and early prepayments made by customers in each period. As a result, the Group adopts a dynamic hedging strategy (sometimes referred to as a ‘macr o’ or ‘portfolio’ hedge) to hedge the exposure profile by closing and entering into new swap agreements at each month -end. The Group uses the portfolio fair value hedge of interest rate risk to recognise fair value changes related to changes in interest ra te risk in the mortgage portfolio, and therefore reduce the profit or loss volatility that would otherwise arise from changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps alone.',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 46 IFRS7(24D) Disclosures not illustrated as not applicable to the Group Paragraph 2 3C of IFRS 7 exempts entities from disclosing the profile of the timing of the nominal amounts and the average price or rate of the hedging instruments for ‘macro’ hedges – as in such hedges entities frequently reset the hedging relationship – and instead requires the disclosure of information included in the illustrative disclosure above. When the volume of such hedging relationships is unrepresentative of normal volumes during the period (i.e. the volume at the reporting date does not reflect the volumes during the period) , an entity shall disclose that fact and the reason it believes the volumes are unrepresentative. Foreign exchange risk on foreign currency debt (cash flow hedge) IFRS7( 22A)(a), (22A)(b), (22A)(c), (22B)(a), (22C) The Group accesses i nternational markets in order to obtain effective sources of funding. As part of this process, the Group assumes significant foreign currency exposure, principally USD. The foreign currency risk component is then managed and mitigated by the use of cross c urrency swaps, which exchange fixed interest payments in the foreign currency for fixed interest payments in CU. These instruments are entered into to match the maturity profile of estimated repayments of the Group’s debt instruments. This hedging strategy is applied to the portion of the exposure that is not naturally offset against matching asset positions held by the Group in financial investments also denominated in foreign currencies. The foreign currency risk component is determined as the change in c ash flows of the foreign currency debt arising solely from changes in the relevant foreign currency forward exchange rate. Such changes constitute a significant component of the overall changes in cash flows of the instrument. IFRS7 22B(b) The effectivene ss of this strategy is assessed by comparing the changes in fair value of the cross currency swap with changes in fair value of the hedged debt attributable to the hedged risk ( changes in foreign currency forward exchange rates ), using the hypothetical der ivative method. IFRS7( 22B)(c), (23D) The Group establishes the hedging ratio by matching the notional of the derivative with the principal of the specific debt instrument being hedged (sometimes referred to as a ‘micro’ hedge). Possible sources of ineffec tiveness are as follows: (i) Differences in timing of cash flows between debt instruments and cross currency swaps; (ii) Differences in the discounting between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, as cash collateralised cross currency swaps are discounted us ing Overnight Indexed Swaps (OIS) discount curves, which are not applied to the foreign debt; (iii) Hedging derivatives with a non -zero fair value at the date of initial designation as a hedging instrument; and (iv) Counterparty credit risk which impacts the fair val ue of uncollateralised cross currency swaps but not the hedged items. IFRS7( 23F) Disclosures not illustrated as not applicable to the Group For cash flow hedges, an entity shall also disclose a description of any forecast transaction for which hedge acco unting had been used in the previous period, but which is no longer expected to occur. Net investment in foreign operation (net investment hedge) IFRS7( 22A)(a), (22A)(b), (22A)(c), (22B)(a), (22B)(b) The Group has an investment in a foreign operation w hich is consolidated in its financial statements and whose functional currency is US Dollars. The foreign exchange rate exposure arising from this investment is hedged through the use of two year FX forward contracts. These contracts are entered into to he dge 90% of the exposure arising from the net assets held in the foreign operation and are rolled forward on a periodic basis. The Group only designates the undiscounted spot element of the FX forwards as hedging instruments. Changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments attributable to changes in forward points and the effect of discounting are recognised directly in profit or loss within the “Net trading income ” line – These amounts are, therefore, not included in the hedge effectiveness assessmen t. IFRS7( 22B)(c), (23D), (22C) The Group establishes the hedging ratio by matching the notional of the forward contracts with 90% of the net assets of the foreign operation. Given that only the undiscounted spot element of the FX forwards is designated i n the hedging relationship, no ineffectiveness is expected unless the foreign operation’s',\n",
       " 'IFRS 9 for banks – Illustrative disclosures PwC 47 losses exceed 10% of net assets during the reporting period. The foreign currency risk component is determined as the change in the carrying amount of net assets of t he foreign operation arising solely from changes in spot foreign currency exchange rates. IFRS7( 23E) Disclosures not illustrated as not applicable to the Group If other sources of hedge ineffectiveness emerge in a hedging relationship, an entity shall dis close those sources by risk category and explain the resulting hedge ineffectiveness. IFRS7( 23B) The following table sets out the maturity profile and average price/rate of the hedging instruments used in the Group’s non -dynamic hedging strategies: Maturity Up to one month One to three months Three months to one year One year to five years More than five years CU’000 CU’000 CU’000 CU’000 CU’000 Cash flow hedges Foreign exchange Cross currency interest rate swap Notional 120 234 443 2,312 652 Average fixed interest rate 5.30% 5.31% 6.34% 9.25% 9.56% Average CU/USD exchange rate 1.23 1.27 1.43 1.51 2.01 Net investment hedge Foreign exchange FX forward Notional – – – 587 – Average CU/USD exchange rate – – – 1.47 – PwC observation – Hedges of multiple risk categories Hedging disclosures are generally required to be provided by risk category. When hedging debt instruments issued in a foreign currency, Banks may elect to hedge interest rate risk as wel l as foreign exchange risk, through the use of cross currency swaps. In the example above, the hedge designated for accounting purposes related only to foreign exchange risk. If both foreign exchange and interest rate risks had been hedged , a new category of “Foreign exchange and interest rate ” would have been required across the hedging disclosures.',\n",

Other disclosures PwC observation – Additional new disclosures introduced by IFRS 9 This note highlights additional new d isclosures required by IFRS 9 that Banks should consider when preparing their financial statements under IFRS 9. 5.1 Financial liabilities designated at FVPL The Group issued a 15 -year note in 2015 with an annual fixed coupon of 4% and which contained a call option that is not closely related to the host contract. The Group designated the entire hybrid contract as a financial liability at fair value through profit or loss. IFRS7 (10)(b) The contractual undiscounted amount that will be required to be pai d at maturity of the above structured note is CU 951,000 greater than its carrying amount of CU 1,791,000. At 31 December 2018, the cumulative own credit adjustment gain amounted to CU 83,000. The cumulative gain is recognised within ‘Other Reserves’ in Equity. Disclosures not illustrated as not applicable to the Group The disclosures requirements in relation to financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss have not changed significantly under IFRS 9. However, the following additional disclosures, which were not applicable to the Group, need to be presented when applicable: IFRS7 (10)(c), (10)(d) (i) For financial liabilities designated at fair value for which changes in the liability’s credit risk are recognised OCI, in addition to disclosure of the cumulative changes in fair value attributable to changes in credit risk of that financial liability and the difference between its carrying amount and the amount contractually required to be paid at maturity (which are also required for f inancial liabilities with all changes presented in profit or loss), disclosure should also be given of transfers of the cumulative gain or loss within equity during the period and the reason for these transfer, and the amount (if any) presented in OCI that was realised on derecognition of f inancial liabilities during the period. IFRS7 (11)(c) (ii) A detailed description of the methodology used to determine whether presenting effects of changes in a liability’s credit risk in OCI would create or enlarge an accou nting mismatch. If an entity is required by paragraph 5.7.8 of IFRS 9 to present the effects of changes in a liability’s credit risk in profit or loss for this reason, the disclosure must include a detailed description of the economic relationship between the characteristics of the liability and the characteristics of the other financial instruments whose change in fair value is expected to be offset within profit or loss. 5.2 Investments in equity instruments designated at FVOCI IFRS7 (11A)(a), (b) The Gr oup has designated at FVOCI investments in a small portfolio of equity securities issued by the following clearing houses and exchanges: Clearing House A; Clearing House B; Exchange C; and Exchange D. The Group chose this presentation alternative because the investments were made for strategic purposes rather than with a view to profit on a subsequent sale, and there are no plans to dispose of these investments in the short or medium term. IFRS7 (11A)(c), (d),(e) The fair value of these investments is CU 753,000 as at 31 December 2018. There was no dividend recognised during the period nor transfers of the cumulative gain within equity.',\n",

IFRS7 (12C) For each reporting period fo llowing a reclassification from FVPL to amortised cost or FVOCI, until derecognition, the Bank should disclose: (a) The effective interest rate determined on the date of reclassification; and (b) The interest revenue recognised. IFRS7 (12D) If, since its last annu al reporting date, a Bank has reclassified a financial asset (i) from FVOCI to amortised cost, or (ii) from FVPL to amortised cost or FVOCI, it shall disclose: (a) The fair value of the financial asset at the end of the period ; and (b) The fair value gain or loss that would have been recognised in profit or loss or OCI during the reporting period if the financial assets had not been reclassified. 5.4 Net gains/(losses) on derecognition of financial assets measured at amortised cost IFRS7 (20A) During the period, the Group sold a portfolio of loans to customers due to a credit risk management decision to eliminate the exposure following a deterioration in credit risk .
