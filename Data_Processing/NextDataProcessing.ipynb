The Climate Guidance \\noffers companies a means of developing their \\nreporting practices and ensuring that investors \\nare receiving the material climate-related \\ninformation needed for efficient and effective \\ncapital allocation to drive the transition to a just, \\nlow-carbon economy.\\n1. Mainstreaming climate \\nreporting\\nCDSB has been working to create and maintain \\nthe enabling conditions for the disclosure \\nof material climate-related information in \\nthe mainstream report since 2007. In that \\ntime, the understanding of the importance \\nand potential impact of climate change has \\ngrown significantly. The Paris Agreement of \\n2015 demonstrated global commitments to \\nratchet up efforts and limit global warming to \\nwell below 2°C and meet the target of 1.5°C. \\nFor businesses, initiatives have been set up \\nto drive change in the private sector, but few \\nhave received the support and attention that \\nthe Task Force on Climate-related Financial \\nDisclosures (TCFD) has.\\n1 Mainstream reports are the annual reporting packages in which \\ncompanies are required to deliver their audited financial results under \\nthe corporate, compliance or securities laws of the country in which \\nthey operate, e.g. the annual report in the UK and the 10-K in the USA.\\n2 Climate Disclosure Standards Board (2019) CDSB Framework for \\nreporting environmental and climate change information.

Available from: https:/ /www.fsb-tcfd.org/\\nwp-content/uploads/2017/06/FINAL-2017-TCFD-Report-11052018.pdfMuch like CDSB, the TCFD’s objective is to elicit \\nbetter quality information from companies on \\nthe macroeconomic risks and opportunities \\nposed by climate change. The TCFD’s Final \\nReport and 11 disclosure recommendations for \\nmainstream reports, which are well aligned \\nwith the CDSB Framework, have changed \\nthe conversation, shifting climate change for \\nmany from a corporate social responsibility or \\nsustainability issue to one that also engages \\nfinance, risk management, and the board and \\nC-suite.3 An increasing number of regulators \\naround the world are also acting to prioritise \\nthe mainstream disclosure of climate-related \\nrisks, opportunities and impacts, understanding \\nthat climate change poses significant risks to \\nthe stability of the financial system and in order \\nto drive action to mitigate these and wider \\nsocietal and environmental risks.\\nDespite much progress, many contend that \\nmore work is needed to ensure that reporting \\non material climate-related issues is of sufficient \\nquality and detail to support decision-making \\nby investors and others. The current standard \\nof mainstream reporting on climate risks \\nand opportunities means that there is an \\ninformation deficit for investors and other \\ndecision-makers. This shortfall in high quality, \\ndecision-useful material climate information \\nmeans that investors are unable to make the \\ncapital allocations that can drive change across \\neconomies and societies.2. CDSB Framework  \\napplication guidance\\nThe Climate Guidance has been designed to \\nhelp companies put into place the thinking and \\nprocesses necessary for high-quality material \\nclimate disclosures and allow them and their \\ninvestors to best navigate the risks and \\nopportunities of climate change. The Climate \\nGuidance is to be used in conjunction with the \\nCDSB Framework, providing additional process, \\nresources and nuance to the Framework to \\nensure that companies are best able to \\nrecognise material climate risks and \\nopportunities and deliver decision-useful \\nclimate information in the mainstream report. \\nThe Climate Guidance will be updated on a \\nregular basis to keep apace of scientific, \\nregulatory and reporting developments, \\nensuring that it continues to highlight and offer \\nadvice on the best reporting practices for \\nmaterial climate-related issues.Like climate change, there are other issues of \\nparticular importance to the understanding of \\ncorporate risk, opportunity, performance and \\nlong-term value creation. As such, the Climate \\nGuidance will be the first of the suite of CDSB \\nFramework application guidance that will each \\nbe designed to enhance the quality of \\ndisclosures for these most material matters. \\nFollowing the Climate Guidance, CDSB will first \\nproduce application guidance for material \\nwater-related issues. Working in conjunction \\nwith the reporting principles and requirements \\nof the CDSB Framework, each application \\nguidance will provide companies with up-to-\\ndate means of developing more coherent and \\ncomplete disclosures and enhancing the \\ndecision-usefulness of their mainstream \\nreporting for the most critical issues (Figure 1).\\nFigure 1.

Structure of the Climate \\nGuidance\\nThe Climate Guidance is designed around the \\nfirst six reporting requirements of the CDSB \\nFramework:\\n•  REQ-01  Governance\\n•  REQ-02  Management’s environmental \\npolicies, strategies and targets\\n•  REQ-03  Risks and opportunities\\n•  REQ-04  Sources of environmental impact\\n•  REQ-05  Performance and comparative \\nanalysis\\n•  REQ-06  Outlook\\nThese six reporting requirements of the CDSB \\nFramework set out the key content elements \\nfor reporting material environmental \\ninformation in the mainstream report. For each \\nof the six reporting requirements, the Climate \\nGuidance provides:\\n•   A checklist for making effective climate \\ndisclosures;\\n•  Detailed reporting suggestions and guidance \\nto complement the CDSB reporting \\nrequirement in relation to climate issues;\\n•  A selection of further useful resources to \\nassist companies in developing their \\nmainstream climate reporting; and\\n•  Explained examples of good practice in \\nmainstream climate reporting.The Climate Guidance also offers some further \\nimportant considerations for companies in \\nmaking mainstream climate disclosures, \\ncovering aspects of the reporting principles \\nand remaining requirements of the CDSB \\nFramework.\\nIn addition, the Climate Guidance provides an \\noverview of the significance of climate change \\nto business, explaining the importance of \\nphysical and transition risks, and highlighting \\nthe key and unique characteristics of the \\nclimate system and their importance to \\ncorporate reporting. Finally, the Appendices to \\nthe Climate Guidance provides a mapping of \\nthe CDSB Framework to the TCFD \\nRecommendations and a list of additional \\nCDSB resources for preparing effective climate \\ndisclosures.\\n', '08 CDSB Framework 09 CDSB Framework 08 CDSB Framework | Application guidance for climate-related disclosures 09 CDSB Framework | Application guidance for climate-related disclosures  \\n2. Key characteristics\\nThese considerations highlight key \\ncharacteristics of climate change that are \\nimportant for companies to properly \\ncomprehend and consider as they seek to \\nunderstand climate-related risks and \\nopportunities, develop strategies, and act to \\nimplement them. Firstly, the climate change \\neffects felt by companies are the result of a \\ncomplexly interconnecting system of \\nenvironmental, social and economic factors. \\nDeveloping effective and resilient climate \\nstrategies, then, requires companies to take \\naccount of many different, changing and \\ninterconnecting systems.\\nSecondly, the complex nature of the climate \\nsystem and its interplays with other \\nenvironmental systems means that climate \\nchange impacts are not always linear in nature. \\nFeedback loops within the climate system, \\nfactors of inertia, and the potential for tipping \\npoints and irreversibility, mean that the full \\nnature and scale of climate change is uncertain \\nand dynamic. These characteristics of climate \\nchange necessitate that companies think in an \\nintegrated manner, taking account of a wide \\nrange of possible global, regional and local \\nimpacts that can be generated by climate \\nchange, and act with proper appreciation.\\nThirdly, and finally, while some impacts of \\nclimate change are certain, others are more \\nuncertain, with varying ranges of potential \\noutcomes over differing timescales and with \\ndiffering likelihoods. The physical and transition \\nrisks and opportunities relevant to a business \\nare unique to each company and highly \\ndynamic. This means that considerations of \\nclimate change and its potential impacts must \\nbe a permanent fixture of corporate thinking \\nfor the decades to come, requiring continued iteration in strategies and targets to reflect \\nscientific, economic, technological or regulatory \\ndevelopments.\\nIn coming years, it appears near inevitable that \\nthere will be a policy response to climate \\nchange that mainstreams and makes \\nmandatory the disclosure of climate-related \\ngovernance, management and strategy, risks \\nand opportunities, and outlooks.8 This Climate \\nGuidance used alongside the CDSB Framework \\nencourages companies to report effectively \\nand efficiently on material climate-related \\ninformation in order to provide investors with \\nuseful and reliable climate-related information \\nto drive their capital allocations. \\n8 UN PRI (2019) The Inevitable Policy Response: Preparing financial \\nmarkets for climate-related policy/regulatory risks. [PDF]. Available \\nfrom: https:/ /www.unpri.org/download?ac=9833The World Economic Forum’s 2020 Global Risk \\nReport illustrates succinctly the scale of the \\npotential impact of climate change on the \\nworld’s social and economic systems.4 Climate \\naction failure is listed as the risk with the \\ngreatest potential for global impact as well as \\nbeing placed at second in terms of likelihood. \\nClimate change, then, is a risk that no country, \\nbusiness or person can ignore or avoid, \\nwhether that is from action or inaction.\\nOn the basis of current policy commitments to \\ncombat climate change, it is estimated that the \\nworld will experience 3°C of warming by 2100,5 \\ndouble the global temperature increase the \\nParis Agreement encourages countries to strive \\nfor. Significantly, carbon emissions continue to \\nrise.6 To limit warming to 1.5°C, the UN \\nEnvironment Programme has estimated an \\nannual 7.6% reduction in emissions is required \\nfrom 2020, necessitating “fundamental \\nstructural changes” to the global economy.7\\n1. Physical and transition risks\\nFor companies, climate-related risks can be \\nunderstood in two general fields – physical risks \\nand transition risks. The former gathers together \\nthe risks posed to businesses from the potential \\nimpacts of a warming climate system as well as \\nthe subsequent impacts of those changes on \\nother environmental systems and resources. \\nPhysical risks therefore encapsulate increased \\nlikelihood and severity of extreme weather \\nevents, sea-level rise, expansion and \\nexacerbation of water stress, ecosystem change \\nand biodiversity loss, for instance. Transition risks, on the other hand, denote those \\ncorporate risks that are associated with the \\nregulatory, economic and societal changes \\nundertaken to try and limit global warming, \\nprimarily through efforts to decarbonise \\neconomic and social activity. Corporate \\ntransition risks include the impact of regulation \\nto stem emissions, shifts in market preferences \\nand the impact of new technologies, to offer \\nthree examples. These transition risks, though, \\nare mirrored by a range of corporate \\nopportunities that come with decarbonisation, \\nsuch as resource efficiency and new products \\nand services.\\nWhile it is helpful to consider the corporate \\nimpact of climate change through these two \\nrisk lenses, in actuality, whichever trajectory the \\nworld or nations follow, companies will have to \\nnavigate, manage and seize an assemblage of \\nphysical and transition risks and opportunities. \\nFor example, if we meet the ambitions of \\nlimiting warming to 1.5°C through economic and \\nsocietal transformation, global warming will still \\naffect the climate system, exacerbating risks \\nand stresses felt by peoples and companies \\naround the world. Indeed, it must be \\nremembered that limiting global warming to \\n1.5°C will still result in regional and local warming \\npatterns far greater than 1.5°C and impacts at \\nan elevated state.\\n4 World Economic Forum (2020) Global Risk Report 2020.

Incentivisation\\nIncentivising appropriate members of the board \\nand management for meeting and fulfilling \\nclimate-related targets and policies is a means \\nof fostering ownership of performance, and \\nreporting on such arrangements in the \\nmainstream report is a means of \\ncommunicating that commitment. Equally \\nimportant, though, is the reporting of the \\nmetrics or criteria used in incentive schemes. \\nThey should speak to the most pertinent risks, \\nopportunities and impacts that have been \\nidentified by the company for climate-related \\nissues. For example, it may be more appropriate \\nfor a bank to tie its climate incentives to \\nperformance on green financing than Scope 1 \\nGHG emissions. Providing ongoing disclosure \\nabout performance and progress towards \\nlong-term targets tied to remuneration is useful.\\n4. Specificity of climate governance\\nCompanies’ climate efforts sometimes form \\npart of broader, cross-cutting environmental \\nstrategies with governance and oversight \\norganised around these broader, interconnected \\nenvironmental ambitions.  However, different \\ninvestors can focus their attention on different \\nmaterial environmental issues when assessing \\ncompanies and reading reports, with climate \\nchange often of particular importance. As such, \\ncompanies should strive to be as explicit as \\npossible in detailing their governance of climate-\\nrelated issues if part of a more connected, \\nenvironmental strategy.Useful resources\\nCommonwealth Climate and Law Initiative , \\nThe climate risk reporting journey: A \\ncorporate governance primer  – This primer, \\nwhich has been designed for corporate \\nboards or responsible committees, offers a \\nset of important questions to guide the \\noversight and governance processes for \\nmaterial climate-related information. This will \\nbe particularly valuable to companies starting \\non their disclosure journey.\\nWorld Economic Forum,  How to Set Up \\nEffective Climate Governance on Corporate \\nBoards: Guiding principles and questions – \\nThis guide from the World Economic Forum \\noffers boards eight principles for effective \\ngovernance, with each accompanied by \\nguiding questions. As well as assisting the \\ndevelopment of good governance, the \\nprinciples and questions offer key areas to \\nconsider in developing their governance \\ndisclosures for climate-related issues.\\nWBCSD , Modernizing Governance: ESG \\nchallenges and recommendations for \\ncorporate directors  – These \\nrecommendations from WBCSD for \\ndeveloping governance practices to meet the \\nchallenges of sustainability offers a useful \\nbasis for developing oversight practices \\naround material climate issues. The points \\nraised in Sections 4, 5 and 6 provide helpful \\nconsiderations for developing governance \\ndisclosures.\\nExamples of good practice\\nAviva , Annual Report and Accounts 2019 – In its annual report, Aviva offers a specific section for \\nclimate-related financial disclosures (pgs. 51-3). In a short governance disclosure, the company \\nidentifies those responsible for climate-related risks and opportunities at board- and \\nmanagement-level. The company highlights that climate is integrated into existing systems and \\nprocesses around risks and opportunities and notes that its board engage with climate issues in \\ntraining programmes.\\nDeutsche Telekom , The 2019 Financial Year – As part of its non-financial statement, the \\ncompany details its strategic and organisational approach to climate and wider sustainability \\nissues in a clear and succinct manner (pgs. 80-1). The disclosure identifies the board-level \\noversight and explains how policies and strategies are managed at a group-level with the \\ninvolvement of different business units and mechanisms in place for guarantees. The disclosure \\nfurther sets out the control mechanisms for climate-related and wider sustainability data for \\ntargets and indicators.2. Application guidance\\nREQ-01  \\nGovernance\\nDisclosures shall describe the governance of \\nenvironmental policies, strategy and information\\nDisclosure checklist\\nDoes the disclosure:\\n Identify the person(s) or committee \\nresponsible for climate policies, strategy and \\ninformation? \\n Explain how climate policies, strategy and \\ninformation are delegated to management? \\n Describe any systems for accountability and \\nincentivisation? \\n Explain whether the governance \\nmechanisms for climate policies, strategies \\nand disclosure differ from other material \\nconcerns and, if so, why?\\n1. Governance arrangements and rationale\\nGovernance disclosures should demonstrate \\ntransparency and accountability for the \\ncompany’s oversight of climate-related matters. \\nEssential is the identification of those with \\nultimate responsibility for the disclosure of \\nclimate-related information, whether that is the \\nCEO or a specific committee or similar.\\nThe most innovative, far-reaching and \\nsuccessful climate strategies will often require \\nthe leadership or integral support of the highest \\ngoverning bodies of a company. Illustrating for \\ninvestors, whether diagrammatically or through \\nclear narrative, where responsibility lies at \\nboard-level and who is driving forward such \\nstrategies at the management level is essential \\nto evidence clear accountability and provide \\ntransparency. It could assist report users to \\nunderstand the decision-making processes for \\nmajor strategic decisions. For instance, what \\nprocesses would allow or require governance \\nbodies to decide to allocate capital, change strategic direction or transform the business \\nmodel in response to identified climate-related \\nrisks and opportunities?\\nIn setting out the governance and management \\narrangements for climate-related policies, \\nstrategies and targets, companies should \\nexplain the rationale for such arrangements. For \\nexample, at a board-level, what qualifications, \\nskills or experience makes the person or \\nmembers of a committee best suited to \\noverseeing the company’s climate strategy? \\nIndeed, some boards and management teams \\nwill draw on external expert advice on general \\nor specific climate-related issues for capacity \\nbuilding and steering. For example, capacity \\nbuilding sessions could be especially \\nappropriate for companies using climate \\nscenario analysis to drive strategy development. \\nOffering details of such external, expert advice \\nin the mainstream report could demonstrate \\nproactive and responsive oversight of climate.\\n2. Information flows and oversight\\nEffective reporting on governance will articulate \\nto investors the connections, information flows \\nand oversight mechanisms that exist between \\nthe board, management and climate-related \\nissues. For example, report users may wish to \\nknow by what means and how often the \\nappropriate board members are informed by \\nmanagement on targets, progress or relevant \\nchanges to the external environment and \\nthrough the supply chain. Which corporate \\ngovernance codes determine or influence the \\nway in which the company is governed? Where \\nappropriate, are there means for responsive \\nstrategic interventions or systems in place to \\nensure resilience? How often does the whole \\nboard discuss the climate strategy and consider \\ndevelopments in climate-related risks and \\nopportunities? These are just four questions that \\nreporting on the governance of material \\nclimate-related issues could answer to \\ndemonstrate that the appropriate organisational \\nand information systems are in place to oversee \\nclimate-related risks and opportunities.\\n', '14 CDSB Framework 15 CDSB Framework 14 CDSB Framework | Application guidance for climate-related disclosures 15 CDSB Framework | Application guidance for climate-related disclosures  \\nREQ-02  \\nManagement’s environmental \\npolicies, strategy and targets\\nDisclosures shall report management’s \\nenvironmental policies, strategy and targets, \\nincluding the indicators, plans and timelines \\nused to assess performance\\nDisclosure checklist\\nDoes the disclosure:\\n Explain the climate-related natural capital \\ndependencies of the company? \\n Describe the climate policies and strategies \\nas well as how they support or link to the \\ncompany’s overall strategies? \\n Detail the resourcing of the delivery and \\nmanagement of climate policies and \\nstrategies? \\n Set out the targets, timelines and indicators \\nfor delivery of climate policy and strategy \\nbeen with methods and baselines, as well as \\nexplain progress or developments?\\n1. Natural capital dependencies\\nThe report user should be able to understand \\nhow the renewable and non-renewable \\nresources and earth systems, such as the \\nclimate, which underpin and support the \\ncompany’s ability to succeed, are reflected in its \\nambitions in meeting climate-related issues. \\nTherefore, it is helpful where companies detail \\ntheir natural capital dependencies. The thinking \\nand guidance in the Natural Capital Protocol9 \\nand International <IR> Framework ,10 for \\nexample, may benefit report preparers in \\nunderstanding and reporting these \\ndependencies. While this Guidance is focused \\non climate, it acknowledges that climate risks \\nand opportunities are inherently interconnected \\nwith other environmental issues, such as water \\nstress and deforestation. This natural capital \\ncontextualisation offers a company the \\nopportunity to:•  Explore risks and opportunities emerging \\nfrom interconnections and relationships \\nbetween different environmental issues;\\n•  Explain to investors its place in the complex \\nweb of natural systems; and\\n•  Consider how to integrate learnings from \\ninterconnections into risk management, \\nstrategy and performance. \\n2. Policies and strategies\\nReport users should be able to understand how \\nthe risk and opportunities identified by \\ncompanies are reflected in strategic \\ndevelopment and how they affect ongoing \\nnatural capital dependency and climate \\nambitions. It may be beneficial to offer further \\njustification in the report, setting out the \\nreasoning behind the adoption of such policies \\nand strategies, explaining how they respond \\neffectively to issues raised in risk and \\nopportunity analysis, dependencies and \\nambitions. Where policies, strategies and \\ntargets have been adopted to deliver climate-\\nrelated risk reduction, these should be explained \\nand appropriately connected with other climate \\ndisclosures, such as the risk management \\nprocesses. If these strategies and targets have \\nbeen developed in connection to important \\nagreements or policies (such as the Paris \\nAgreement or a national decarbonisation \\npathways) or sectoral and climate programmes \\n(such as Science Based Targets) then the \\nimportance and relevance to the company \\nshould be explained.\\nWhen adopting and reporting on the details of \\nthe policies, strategies and targets for material \\nclimate issues, considerations of geography and \\ntime should be central. Climate-related risks and \\nopportunities vary greatly according to location \\nand time horizon. For example, some climate-\\nrelated regulations are more likely in one \\ncountry than another at any point in time, and \\nthe nature and severity of climate impacts, such \\nas extreme weather and temperature increases, \\nwill vary significantly between regions.

The type of target and indicator, the \\nbase and timeline, and the scope should be \\nclearly described to investors and connected \\nwith the overall strategy. For example, if a \\ncompany has adopted a net zero carbon pledge \\nfor 2050, useful supporting information would \\ninclude absolute GHG emissions metrics, \\nindicators, milestones and targets up to 2050, \\nand details of how business operations will \\ncontribute to the company-wide target. \\nLikewise, it may be beneficial to set timelines \\naccording to how the company has defined the \\nshort-, medium- and long-term in its risk and \\noutlook analyses. Progress towards targets may \\nbe expressed in terms of reducing negative \\nimpacts, but also through more proactive \\ntargets, such as value of green investments, \\npercentage of research and development that is \\nlow-carbon focused, or numbers of renewable \\npurchase power agreements. Targets such as \\nthese provide greater connectivity to financial \\nand core business performance.\\nAs a company progresses with its climate \\nstrategies and policies, it is beneficial to explain \\nhow it is advancing and what factors have been \\nintrinsic to achieving or surpassing the targets. \\nMore importantly, where it is the case that \\nindicators or targets have been or are likely to \\nbe missed, this should be rationalised, detailing \\nfactors that were significant and explaining \\nwhat could have been and could not be \\ncontrolled or better managed. Explaining how \\nstrategies will be adapted to improve \\nperformance as a result would be of particular \\nimportance to report users.4. Resourcing\\nFinally, when reporting on climate-related \\npolicies, strategies and targets, companies \\nshould set out the resourcing, both financial and \\npersonnel, for meeting the delivery of the \\nclimate policies and strategy. Again, such detail \\nin an annual report can offer investors \\nreassurance of the company’s commitment and \\neffort to meeting its climate ambitions. \\nReporting on resourcing is especially important \\nif the company’s strategy requires significant \\ncapital investment or operation reorganisation \\nto meet its ambitions.\\nUseful resources\\nCapitals Coalition , Natural Capital Protocol  \\n– Steps 2, 3 and 4 of the Protocol will assist \\ncompanies in understanding their natural \\ncapital dependencies (and impacts), \\nproviding a basis for developing effective \\nclimate-related policies, strategies and \\ntargets.

For this \\nreason, risk management approaches, horizon \\nscanning, forecasting, sensitivity testing and \\nscenario analysis, which is discussed further \\nbelow in relation to REQ-06, are amongst the \\npractical tools that can guide companies in their \\nassessment of risk and opportunities.\\n1. Detailing risks and opportunities\\nWhen reporting material climate-related risks \\nand opportunities in the mainstream report, \\nthoroughly describing and detailing them, \\nspecifying the key characteristics of the risk or \\nopportunity and explaining its relevance to the \\ncompany and its operations, offers useful \\ninformation. In terms of characteristics for high \\nquality reporting, it is essential to properly \\naccount for where the risk or opportunity may \\nmaterialise, specifying whether it concerns a \\nspecific business area, a particular region of \\noperations or along the supply chain, for \\ninstance. Given the variability and complexity of \\nclimate issues over different time horizons, it is \\nimportant for companies to explain the \\ntimeframes of risks and opportunities, \\nhighlighting when they could be expected to \\nmaterialise and how they may develop through \\ntime. Where climate-related risks intersect with \\nother business and environmental risks in \\namplifying manners, it is prudent for companies \\nto identify and explain such connections and \\nfeedbacks.\\n2. Quantification and financial impact\\nAs well as describing the key details and \\nrelevance of the material climate-related risks \\nand opportunities, decision-useful disclosures \\nwill further set out the business implications \\nand, where possible, quantify the risks and \\nopportunities over appropriate timeframes. \\nWhen valuing the risks or opportunities, the \\nreader should be offered the assumptions and \\nessential figures (e.g. present value of asset or revenue stream affected) as well as the \\nuncertainties for the financial figure, especially if \\nthe size of the risk or opportunity varies largely \\nover time. In addition, the mainstream report \\nshould be designed in a manner that allows the \\nreader to navigate from these risks and \\nopportunities to the policies and strategies \\ndeveloped to manage them, as is expected \\nfrom REQ-02.\\n3. Connecting information\\nIn addition, while the CDSB Framework does \\nnot set out specific reporting requirements, \\nPrinciple 3 encourages companies to explain \\nwhether and to what extent climate-related \\nissues are connected with other information and \\nresults in the mainstream report, with REQ-03 \\nexplaining that links should be made to \\nreporting of processes and systems for risks \\nand opportunities. For example, report users \\nshould be able to understand how climate-\\nrelated issues have been incorporated into \\nexisting systems of risk identification and \\nprioritisation and whether the systems have \\nbeen adapted to accommodate the \\ncharacteristics of climate-related issues. \\nImportant when reporting material climate risks \\nand opportunities is to explain how the \\ncompany considers short-, medium- and \\nlong-term issues in risk management systems. \\nFurther, it will be the case that the systems used \\nto identify climate-related risks and \\nopportunities will develop in coming years with \\ngreater understanding of climatic, regulatory \\nand technological pathways. Setting out for \\nreport users how the company is developing \\nand adapting these systems will demonstrate \\nresponsive and effective management.Useful resources\\nBank of England , Climate change: What are the risks to financial stability? – This short \\nintroduction to physical and transition climate risks and their importance to the global economy \\nis a good starting point for those new to these ideas. \\nMcKinsey,  Climate Risk and Response provides a more in-depth analysis of these risks with \\nhelpful case studies, which may also assist in developing disclosures for REQ-06.\\nCOSO and WBCSD , Applying enterprise risk management to environmental, social and \\ngovernance-related risks  – Developed by COSO and WBCSD, this guidance offers a thorough \\nand logical process for developing effective risk management processes for climate-related and \\nwider sustainability risks, including identification, prioritisation, and implementing response. \\nChapter 5 further offers guidance on how to best report on risks and their identification and \\nmanagement.\\nTCFD , Final Report: Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures  \\n– The TCFD recommendations offer an in-depth set of disclosures for material climate-related risks \\nand opportunities and their governance and management.

Material sources of climate impact\\nAs well as expecting companies to report their \\ntargets and indicators for material climate-\\nrelated issues, the CDSB Framework sets out \\nthat companies should disclose their results for \\nmaterial sources of climate-related impacts in \\ntheir mainstream reports. Principle 1 of the \\nCDSB Framework offers companies a means to \\nassist them in identifying relevant and then \\nmaterial environmental information, including \\nsources of impact. In addition, the CDSB \\nFramework takes the position that Scope 1 and \\n2 GHG emissions of the company should be \\nregarded as material and included in the \\nmainstream report.\\nIt will often be the case that the material sources \\nof climate impact will reflect the natural capital \\ndependencies, risks and opportunities, and \\nambitions that drive the formation of policies, \\nstrategies and targets for climate issues. \\nHowever, where it is necessary for clarity, the \\nresults should be accompanied by an \\nexplanation of the materiality of the source of climate impact to the company. It might be that \\ncompanies are disclosing on material sources of \\nenvironmental impact in their sustainability \\nreports, CDP responses or index questionnaires. \\nSuch disclosures can be repurposed to be \\nincluded in the mainstream report and satisfy \\nREQ-04 of the CDSB Framework. Table 2 offers \\nan example set of common potential sources of \\nclimate impact.\\n2. Decision-useful information\\nWhen reporting results on material sources of \\nclimate impact, it should be considered what \\nconstitutes decision-useful information – \\nconsistency, comparability, clarity and \\nverifiability – as set out in Principles 4, 5 and 6 of \\nthe CDSB Framework.\\nIn satisfying these key characteristics, the \\napplicability of the metrics and indicators \\nchosen to report on material sources of climate \\nimpact, such as sector or industry and/or \\nnational standards for reporting, should be \\nconsidered. In addition, results should be \\nreported in absolute and intensity terms, with \\ncompany revenue and/or appropriate non-\\nfinancial output measures (e.g. emissions per a \\nstandard unit of product) being used to \\nnormalise the results. Further, companies should \\nensure that they do not conflate their results for \\nmaterial sources of climate impact with possible \\nmitigation activities, such as carbon offsetting \\nschemes. The latter should be reported where \\nrelevant and material, but in a manner that is \\ndistinct from the material sources of impact, \\notherwise it may mislead the report user.\\n3. Disaggregation and categorisation\\nTo benefit comparability and understandability, \\nit can be helpful to disaggregate and categorise \\nresults in terms of geography and business \\nactivity to better appreciate impact and report \\nthese alongside total results. For instance, if the \\nmajority of deforestation and land use change in \\nproduction, and therefore GHG emissions, \\noccurs within a country with threatened \\nbiodiversity, then it is important for investors to \\nunderstand this differentiation of impact. In the reporting of their material sources of \\nclimate impact results, it is beneficial to report \\nusers to offer brief explanations to the \\nappropriateness of reporting choices for \\nmetrics, intensity factors and means of \\ndisaggregation. Given that it is common for \\nselective reporting on corporate impact, such \\nexplanations offer further confidence in the \\ndata disclosed. In addition, setting out clearly the methodologies used for preparation of \\ndisclosures will add to the validity and \\nusefulness of the results. Where there are \\nuncertainties and gaps in the climate data or \\nwhere methods and assumptions have been \\namended, highlighting and offering an \\nexplanation to report users for these differences \\ncan alleviate confusions or misconceptions.\\nSources of climate impact Description\\nScope 1 and 2 GHG emissions Defined as material for all companies by the CDSB \\nFramework, Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions are all the \\ndirect emissions from the company or under its control \\n(Scope 1) and the indirect emissions from energy \\npurchased and used by the company or those under its \\ncontrol (Scope 2).\\nScope 3 GHG emissions Scope 3 GHG emissions collects all other indirect \\nemissions from the activities of the company from \\nsources that they do not own or control, both upstream \\nand downstream (e.g. purchased goods and use of sold \\nproducts, respectively).\\nNon-/Renewable energy generation, use and \\nconsumptionElectricity and heat production are among the largest \\ncontributor to GHG emissions. Electricity generation \\nwill need to expand and switch to renewable sources \\nfor decarbonisation. \\nTransportation Transportation contributes a significant proportion to \\nannual GHG emissions and is a key area for global \\nefforts to disassociate economic growth from GHG \\nemissions, with different transition pathways expected \\nfor each form.\\nLand use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) Land use, change and forestry are key sources of \\nemissions and LULUCF is part of international GHG \\ninventories, capturing both the addition and withdrawal \\nof GHGs that land can facilitate.\\nWater use and reuse Global warming will exacerbate and expand areas of \\nwater stress, putting supplies at risk for people and \\nbusiness.\\nTable 2  Common examples of sources of climate impact, with a description of each and how \\nthey contribute or are connected to climate issues.', '22 CDSB Framework 23 CDSB Framework 22 CDSB Framework | Application guidance for climate-related disclosures 23 CDSB Framework | Application guidance for climate-related disclosures  \\nExamples of good practice\\nSSE, Annual Report 2019 – In its strategic report, SSE details its climate and environmental \\nimpact, targets and broader strategy (pgs. 28-31). The company summarises its performance on \\nclimate impact with five metrics, three of which are externally assured, as well as providing its \\nScope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions in totals and appropriately categorised. These results are \\npresented with narrative that explains performance and provides targets. In addition, the \\ncompany directs users to supplementary data and information sources outside the mainstream \\nreport.\\nBASF , BASF Report 2019 –  As part of its management report, BASF offers a clear set of results \\nfor its climate impact. The company presents its Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions with clear \\nreference to methods used as well as presenting offsetting and biomass measures separately. \\nThe company further presents data on energy and electricity supply, aggregating these \\naccording to source, and water use and stress. These results are all reported with explanations \\nthat consistently connect to the strategy and targets of the company.Useful resources\\nCDP, Corporate Climate Change, Forests and Water Security Questionnaires – Many of the world’s \\nlargest companies already disclose information and data to CDP annually on material sources of \\nclimate impact. CDP submissions can provide a useful, well-structured basis for developing \\nmainstream disclosures in response to REQ-04 as well as other reporting requirements of the \\nCDSB Framework, such as on governance, strategies and targets, and outlook.\\nThe GHG Protocol Initiative , The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and \\nReporting Standard  – The GHG Protocol’s corporate standard offers a set of requirements and \\naccompanying guidance for developing and reporting GHG inventories for Scope 1 and 2 \\nemissions, which are material for all companies implementing the CDSB Framework.

SASB has found climate to be material in 72 of 79 industries. \\nThese metrics could also be beneficial for target setting in REQ-02 as well as for REQ-04.REQ-05  \\nPerformance and comparative \\nanalysis\\nDisclosures shall include an analysis of the \\ninformation disclosed in REQ-04 compared \\nwith any performance targets set and with \\nresults reported in a previous period\\nDisclosure checklist\\nDoes the disclosure:\\n Provide appropriate historical data to the \\nresults reported from REQ-04 for material \\nclimate impact to allow for useful \\ncomparison? \\n Contextualise the performance with \\nbaselines, targets and other criteria used to \\nassess progress? \\n Explain the major trends with reference to, \\nfor example, climate strategies, business \\ndevelopments, or political and economic \\nchanges?circumstances, such changes are made to \\nimprove accuracy or meet new standards. \\nWhere changes are made to methods, \\nrestatements should be produced, as in REQ-10 \\nof the CDSB Framework, to draw attention to \\nthese changes and an explanation offered.\\nWhere targets have been set for material \\nsources of climate impact, it is useful to restate \\nthe overall ambition and the baseline, clarifying \\nfor the reader as to whether the targets are part \\nof a corporate initiative or scheme, or tied to \\nwider national or international ambitions. Such \\ntargets offer an effective means of providing a \\nnarrative analysis of performance to reduce \\nclimate impact. In explaining trends, companies \\nshould draw the reader’s attention to the \\nimpacts of environmental initiatives, wider \\ncorporate developments, regulatory changes \\nand factors outside the control of the company. \\nFor example, a spike in energy usage might be \\nthe result of a significant acquisition, or a \\nsignificant drop in Scope 2 GHG emissions \\ncould come as a result of the onboarding of \\nrenewable energy in the grid. Such narratives, \\nthen, should try to illustrate a more total climate \\nimpact, making connections across different \\naspects of the corporate report in so doing. \\nTo offer report users proper comparability \\nbetween past and present performance on \\nmaterial sources of climate impact, companies \\nneed to ensure that they are offering an \\nappropriate number of historical datapoints. \\nPrinciple 2 of the CDSB Framework sets out \\nthat disclosures should include “all information \\nthat is necessary for an understanding of the \\nmatter that it purports to represent and does \\nnot leave out details that could cause \\ninformation to be false or misleading to users.” \\nNarrow dataset windows or intermittent, \\nlonger-term datasets are unsuitable for \\ncomparison and decision-making, for instance, \\npotentially obscuring the actual trends of \\nimpact. As an example, short-term perspectives \\non Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions might conceal a \\ntrend of emissions shifting from Scope 1 and 2 \\nto 3. For some, such longer-term measures of \\nimpact and performance will not be possible for \\nnot having collected the data for long enough, \\nwhich should be explained where it hinders \\nreport users.\\nIn addition, consistency needs to be applied to \\ntechniques used for data gathering and \\nprocessing to allow for proper comparability \\nand understanding of performance.

Scenario analysis\\nScenario analysis can be conducted through \\ndifferent routes including consultation with \\ncompany and external experts or scientific \\nanalysis. There is no special or correct formula \\nby which it is to be completed. Instead, it is a \\nprocess to analyse a suite of potential futures, REQ-06 of the CDSB Framework encourages \\ncompanies to provide a future-oriented \\nsummary that enables report users to \\nunderstand  how a company’s climate-related \\nrisks, opportunities and impacts are affecting, or understanding the company, its dependencies \\nand strategic resilience, within the different \\nforces that drive each of the futures. Some will \\ndo this through quantitative modelling, others \\nwill not. For climate-related issues, assessing a \\nrange of future climate states, taking into \\naccount a range of different warming levels (e.g. \\n1.5, 2, 3 and greater than 4°C) and transition \\npathways (e.g. drastic to 1.5°C, relatively more \\ngradual 2°C, technologically-enabled 1.5°C) will \\nelicit important information for companies and \\nreport users. The scenarios developed by the \\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \\n(IPCC) and the International Energy Agency \\n(IEA) are used by governments and regulators \\naround the world, and therefore offer a reliable \\nbasis for companies to consider their potential \\nfutures.\\nThe use of scenario analysis will be based on \\niterative learning and development. This will \\nallow companies to build on findings or \\nmethods employed previously as well as \\nincorporate more up-to-date understanding of \\nclimate change, other environmental systems \\nand their interactions as well as greater \\ncomprehension of climate resilient pathways. If \\nusing scenario analysis, then report preparers \\nshould be open with these aspects of learning \\nand development.\\n2. Methods, assumptions and uncertainties\\nIn reporting on corporate outlook, report users \\nshould be able to understand the different \\nmethods that have been used to prepare the \\noutlook, including horizon scanning and \\nscenario analysis, any assumptions made and \\nthe timeframes over which the analysis has \\nbeen completed. These different characteristics \\nof the scenarios should reflect the nature of the \\ncompany, its assets and operations, and the \\nscale of risks and opportunities already \\nidentified. In addition, where external advice or \\nassistance on conducting scenario analysis is \\nused, it is beneficial for this to be highlighted \\nwithin the methods and inputs. In reporting the effectiveness and resilience of \\nthe company’s strategies to the potential \\nbusiness impacts of the different scenarios, \\nreport preparers should be clear about \\nuncertainties but as precise as possible with \\nhow the impacts of risks differ by geography, \\noperations and time horizon. Clear articulation \\nof the specific sensitivities to the different \\nscenarios will allow report users to better \\nunderstand the potential responses identified \\nby the company as a result of the exercise, \\nwhether that is no response, changes to \\nfinancial planning and investment, or \\nreimagining the business model.\\n3. Iteration and learning\\nClimate-related risks and opportunities are \\nhighly dynamic and dependent upon changes \\nin complex climate systems and political, \\neconomic and societal arenas as well as the \\nexposure of the company or asset and its \\nassociated vulnerabilities.11 The qualities and \\ndimensions of climate-related risks and \\nopportunities for companies are likely to change \\nover time, whether gradually or abruptly. Given \\nthis, using the findings of such exercises to \\nassess corporate outlook are an important \\nmeans of updating risk and opportunity \\nidentification systems and refine or reformulate \\nclimate-related policies, strategies and targets. \\nThis will better prepare the company in limiting \\nand seizing climate-related risks and \\nopportunities.

Important considerations\\nWhile the Climate Guidance has focused on the \\nfirst six reporting requirements of the CDSB \\nFramework, companies should not mistake the \\nimportance of the remaining six reporting \\nrequirements, which are essential to \\ncompleteness. In addition, when developing \\nmaterial climate disclosures, companies should \\nensure that the seven guiding principles of the \\nCDSB Framework are followed to ensure \\nhigh-quality, decision-useful reporting. Below, \\nwe draw attention to three, more particular \\nconsiderations to assist report preparers in \\ndeveloping mainstream climate disclosures in \\nline with the CDSB Framework.\\n1. Relevance and materiality\\nWhen seeking to use the climate-related \\nguidance offered for REQ-01 to REQ-06 of the \\nCDSB Framework, companies must ensure that \\nthe principles of relevance and materiality have \\nbeen applied. The Climate Guidance is designed \\nfor companies who have identified climate-\\nrelated risks and opportunities as material, but \\nnot all of the suggested reporting practices \\noffered will necessarily be applicable for \\ninclusion in the mainstream report of all \\ncompanies that have deemed climate material. \\nThe reporting practices of the Climate Guidance \\nshould be applied and disclosed against, like all \\ninformation for the mainstream report, when the \\ninformation is deemed material by the company. \\nPrinciple 1 of the CDSB Framework offers that \\ninformation is material if:\\n•  The impacts or results it describes are, due to \\ntheir size and nature, expected to have a \\nsignificant positive or negative impact on the \\ncompany’s financial condition and operational \\nresults and its ability to execute its strategy; or\\n• Omitting, misstating or obscuring it could \\nreasonably be expected to influence the \\ndecisions that users of mainstream reports \\nmake on the basis of that mainstream report, \\nwhich provides information about a specific \\nreporting company.REQ-11 of the CDSB Framework encourages \\ncompanies include a statement of conformance, \\nsetting out the extent that the principles and \\nreporting requirements of the CDSB Framework \\nhave been applied. In doing so, companies are \\nexpected to state the outcome of applying the \\nrelevance and materiality principle.\\n2. Reporting boundaries and periods\\nREQ-07 of the CDSB Framework concerns the \\nreporting boundaries employed by the \\ncompany for the mainstream report. The CDSB \\nFramework holds that the material climate-\\nrelated information disclosed should be \\nprepared according to the reporting boundaries \\nused for the rest of the mainstream report. It \\nmay, however, be that climate-related \\ninformation that falls outside this reporting \\nboundary will be appropriate for inclusion in the \\nmainstream report, such as relating to \\noutsourced activities or where contracts expose \\na company to climate-related risks or \\nopportunities. A common example of this is \\nScope 3 GHG emissions. REQ-07 of the CDSB \\nFramework offers that information and data \\nfrom outside the reporting boundary should be \\ndistinguished and the company’s approach to \\nboundary setting be reported. More information \\non boundary setting and reporting can be \\nfound in CDSB’s Proposals for boundary setting \\nin the mainstream report (see Appendix 3).\\nIn addition to the reporting boundary, REQ-09 \\nof the CDSB Framework suggests that the \\nmaterial climate-related information and data \\nincluded in the mainstream report should follow \\nthe reporting period of the rest of the report. \\nAligning the reporting period of the climate-\\nrelated information included in the mainstream \\nreport better ensures that it can be connected \\nwith the other information disclosed, such as \\nfinancial performance and other environmental \\ndata, and so enhance comparability, as \\nadvocated by Principles 3 and 4, respectively, of \\nthe CDSB Framework.\\n3. Using existing disclosures and resources\\nThe CDSB Framework and its reporting \\nrequirements intend to align with and \\n', '28 CDSB Framework \\n 28 CDSB Framework | Application guidance for climate-related disclosures\\ncomplement existing mainstream financial \\ndisclosures. It will be the case, then, that \\ncompanies may already satisfy certain aspects \\nof the reporting requirements of the CDSB \\nFramework and the suggestions of Climate \\nGuidance. Principle 3 of the CDSB Framework \\nemphasises the importance of ensuring that \\nmaterial environmental disclosures, including \\nthose regarding climate issues, are connected \\nwith other mainstream disclosures. The principle \\ninforms report preparers that disclosures should \\nbe formulated and positioned in a way to allow \\ninvestors to see and understand the linkages. In \\ndeveloping their mainstream reporting \\npractices, companies should try and ensure that \\nthe language and labelling used best allows for \\nclear understanding of these interconnections \\nand avoids unnecessary duplication or \\nconfusion of information. In addition, companies may already be \\ndisclosing material climate information that \\nwould be appropriate for mainstream disclosure \\nin line with the CDSB Framework through \\ndifferent reporting channels, such as in \\nsustainability reports, CDP submissions and \\nindex or investor questionnaires. Repurposing \\nthese existing disclosures to meet the specific \\nrequirements of the mainstream report could \\nbenefit and streamline reporting practices. \\nSimilarly, report preparers may also be able to \\nuse the financial accounting standards used for \\nits mainstream reporting to report on certain \\naspects of climate-related financial information, \\nwhich is further explored in CDSB’s Uncharted \\nwaters (see Appendix 3).

       " 'CDSB Framework 05 CDSB Framework 04 CDSB Framework | Application guidance for climate-related disclosures 05 CDSB Framework | Application guidance for climate-related disclosures The CDSB Framework application guidance for climate-related disclosure (Climate Guidance) has been produced by the Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB) to assist companies in the disclosure of material climate-related information in the mainstream report.1 It is designed to complement the CDSB Framework for reporting environmental and climate change information (CDSB Framework)2 and other frameworks, codes and recommendations that are aligned with some or all of the requirements of the CDSB Framework. The Climate Guidance offers companies a means of developing their reporting practices and ensuring that investors are receiving the material climate-related information needed for efficient and effective capital allocation to drive the transition to a just, low-carbon economy. 1. Mainstreaming climate reporting CDSB has been working to create and maintain the enabling conditions for the disclosure of material climate-related information in the mainstream report since 2007. In that time, the understanding of the importance and potential impact of climate change has grown significantly. The Paris Agreement of 2015 demonstrated global commitments to ratchet up efforts and limit global warming to well below 2°C and meet the target of 1.5°C. For businesses, initiatives have been set up to drive change in the private sector, but few have received the support and attention that the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) has. 1 Mainstream reports are the annual reporting packages in which companies are required to deliver their audited financial results under the corporate, compliance or securities laws of the country in which they operate, e.g. the annual report in the UK and the 10-K in the USA. 2 Climate Disclosure Standards Board (2019) CDSB Framework for reporting environmental and climate change information.

[PDF]. Available from: https:/ /www.fsb-tcfd.org/ wp-content/uploads/2017/06/FINAL-2017-TCFD-Report-11052018.pdfMuch like CDSB, the TCFD’s objective is to elicit better quality information from companies on the macroeconomic risks and opportunities posed by climate change. The TCFD’s Final Report and 11 disclosure recommendations for mainstream reports, which are well aligned with the CDSB Framework, have changed the conversation, shifting climate change for many from a corporate social responsibility or sustainability issue to one that also engages finance, risk management, and the board and C-suite.3 An increasing number of regulators around the world are also acting to prioritise the mainstream disclosure of climate-related risks, opportunities and impacts, understanding that climate change poses significant risks to the stability of the financial system and in order to drive action to mitigate these and wider societal and environmental risks. Despite much progress, many contend that more work is needed to ensure that reporting on material climate-related issues is of sufficient quality and detail to support decision-making by investors and others. The current standard of mainstream reporting on climate risks and opportunities means that there is an information deficit for investors and other decision-makers. This shortfall in high quality, decision-useful material climate information means that investors are unable to make the capital allocations that can drive change across economies and societies.2. CDSB Framework application guidance The Climate Guidance has been designed to help companies put into place the thinking and processes necessary for high-quality material climate disclosures and allow them and their investors to best navigate the risks and opportunities of climate change. The Climate Guidance is to be used in conjunction with the CDSB Framework, providing additional process, resources and nuance to the Framework to ensure that companies are best able to recognise material climate risks and opportunities and deliver decision-useful climate information in the mainstream report. The Climate Guidance will be updated on a regular basis to keep apace of scientific, regulatory and reporting developments, ensuring that it continues to highlight and offer advice on the best reporting practices for material climate-related issues.Like climate change, there are other issues of particular importance to the understanding of corporate risk, opportunity, performance and long-term value creation. As such, the Climate Guidance will be the first of the suite of CDSB Framework application guidance that will each be designed to enhance the quality of disclosures for these most material matters. Following the Climate Guidance, CDSB will first produce application guidance for material water-related issues. Working in conjunction with the reporting principles and requirements of the CDSB Framework, each application guidance will provide companies with up-to- date means of developing more coherent and complete disclosures and enhancing the decision-usefulness of their mainstream reporting for the most critical issues (Figure 1).

       " 'CDSB Framework 06 CDSB Framework | Application guidance for climate-related disclosures Climate change and business Chapter 2 3. Structure of the Climate Guidance The Climate Guidance is designed around the first six reporting requirements of the CDSB Framework: • REQ-01 Governance • REQ-02 Management’s environmental policies, strategies and targets • REQ-03 Risks and opportunities • REQ-04 Sources of environmental impact • REQ-05 Performance and comparative analysis • REQ-06 Outlook These six reporting requirements of the CDSB Framework set out the key content elements for reporting material environmental information in the mainstream report. For each of the six reporting requirements, the Climate Guidance provides: • A checklist for making effective climate disclosures; • Detailed reporting suggestions and guidance to complement the CDSB reporting requirement in relation to climate issues; • A selection of further useful resources to assist companies in developing their mainstream climate reporting; and • Explained examples of good practice in mainstream climate reporting.The Climate Guidance also offers some further important considerations for companies in making mainstream climate disclosures, covering aspects of the reporting principles and remaining requirements of the CDSB Framework. In addition, the Climate Guidance provides an overview of the significance of climate change to business, explaining the importance of physical and transition risks, and highlighting the key and unique characteristics of the climate system and their importance to corporate reporting. Finally, the Appendices to the Climate Guidance provides a mapping of the CDSB Framework to the TCFD Recommendations and a list of additional CDSB resources for preparing effective climate disclosures.',\n",

Key characteristics These considerations highlight key characteristics of climate change that are important for companies to properly comprehend and consider as they seek to understand climate-related risks and opportunities, develop strategies, and act to implement them. Firstly, the climate change effects felt by companies are the result of a complexly interconnecting system of environmental, social and economic factors. Developing effective and resilient climate strategies, then, requires companies to take account of many different, changing and interconnecting systems. Secondly, the complex nature of the climate system and its interplays with other environmental systems means that climate change impacts are not always linear in nature. Feedback loops within the climate system, factors of inertia, and the potential for tipping points and irreversibility, mean that the full nature and scale of climate change is uncertain and dynamic. These characteristics of climate change necessitate that companies think in an integrated manner, taking account of a wide range of possible global, regional and local impacts that can be generated by climate change, and act with proper appreciation. Thirdly, and finally, while some impacts of climate change are certain, others are more uncertain, with varying ranges of potential outcomes over differing timescales and with differing likelihoods. The physical and transition risks and opportunities relevant to a business are unique to each company and highly dynamic. This means that considerations of climate change and its potential impacts must be a permanent fixture of corporate thinking for the decades to come, requiring continued iteration in strategies and targets to reflect scientific, economic, technological or regulatory developments. In coming years, it appears near inevitable that there will be a policy response to climate change that mainstreams and makes mandatory the disclosure of climate-related governance, management and strategy, risks and opportunities, and outlooks.8 This Climate Guidance used alongside the CDSB Framework encourages companies to report effectively and efficiently on material climate-related information in order to provide investors with useful and reliable climate-related information to drive their capital allocations. 8 UN PRI (2019) The Inevitable Policy Response: Preparing financial markets for climate-related policy/regulatory risks. [PDF]. Available from: https:/ /www.unpri.org/download?ac=9833The World Economic Forum’s 2020 Global Risk Report illustrates succinctly the scale of the potential impact of climate change on the world’s social and economic systems.4 Climate action failure is listed as the risk with the greatest potential for global impact as well as being placed at second in terms of likelihood. Climate change, then, is a risk that no country, business or person can ignore or avoid, whether that is from action or inaction. On the basis of current policy commitments to combat climate change, it is estimated that the world will experience 3°C of warming by 2100,5 double the global temperature increase the Paris Agreement encourages countries to strive for. Significantly, carbon emissions continue to rise.6 To limit warming to 1.5°C, the UN Environment Programme has estimated an annual 7.6% reduction in emissions is required from 2020, necessitating “fundamental structural changes” to the global economy.7 1. Physical and transition risks For companies, climate-related risks can be understood in two general fields – physical risks and transition risks. The former gathers together the risks posed to businesses from the potential impacts of a warming climate system as well as the subsequent impacts of those changes on other environmental systems and resources. Physical risks therefore encapsulate increased likelihood and severity of extreme weather events, sea-level rise, expansion and exacerbation of water stress, ecosystem change and biodiversity loss, for instance. Transition risks, on the other hand, denote those corporate risks that are associated with the regulatory, economic and societal changes undertaken to try and limit global warming, primarily through efforts to decarbonise economic and social activity. Corporate transition risks include the impact of regulation to stem emissions, shifts in market preferences and the impact of new technologies, to offer three examples. These transition risks, though, are mirrored by a range of corporate opportunities that come with decarbonisation, such as resource efficiency and new products and services. While it is helpful to consider the corporate impact of climate change through these two risk lenses, in actuality, whichever trajectory the world or nations follow, companies will have to navigate, manage and seize an assemblage of physical and transition risks and opportunities. For example, if we meet the ambitions of limiting warming to 1.5°C through economic and societal transformation, global warming will still affect the climate system, exacerbating risks and stresses felt by peoples and companies around the world. Indeed, it must be remembered that limiting global warming to 1.5°C will still result in regional and local warming patterns far greater than 1.5°C and impacts at an elevated state. 4 World Economic Forum (2020) Global Risk Report 2020.

Incentivisation Incentivising appropriate members of the board and management for meeting and fulfilling climate-related targets and policies is a means of fostering ownership of performance, and reporting on such arrangements in the mainstream report is a means of communicating that commitment. Equally important, though, is the reporting of the metrics or criteria used in incentive schemes. They should speak to the most pertinent risks, opportunities and impacts that have been identified by the company for climate-related issues. For example, it may be more appropriate for a bank to tie its climate incentives to performance on green financing than Scope 1 GHG emissions. Providing ongoing disclosure about performance and progress towards long-term targets tied to remuneration is useful. 4. Specificity of climate governance Companies’ climate efforts sometimes form part of broader, cross-cutting environmental strategies with governance and oversight organised around these broader, interconnected environmental ambitions. However, different investors can focus their attention on different material environmental issues when assessing companies and reading reports, with climate change often of particular importance. As such, companies should strive to be as explicit as possible in detailing their governance of climate- related issues if part of a more connected, environmental strategy.Useful resources Commonwealth Climate and Law Initiative , The climate risk reporting journey: A corporate governance primer – This primer, which has been designed for corporate boards or responsible committees, offers a set of important questions to guide the oversight and governance processes for material climate-related information. This will be particularly valuable to companies starting on their disclosure journey. World Economic Forum, How to Set Up Effective Climate Governance on Corporate Boards: Guiding principles and questions – This guide from the World Economic Forum offers boards eight principles for effective governance, with each accompanied by guiding questions. As well as assisting the development of good governance, the principles and questions offer key areas to consider in developing their governance disclosures for climate-related issues. WBCSD , Modernizing Governance: ESG challenges and recommendations for corporate directors – These recommendations from WBCSD for developing governance practices to meet the challenges of sustainability offers a useful basis for developing oversight practices around material climate issues. The points raised in Sections 4, 5 and 6 provide helpful considerations for developing governance disclosures. Examples of good practice Aviva , Annual Report and Accounts 2019 – In its annual report, Aviva offers a specific section for climate-related financial disclosures (pgs. 51-3). In a short governance disclosure, the company identifies those responsible for climate-related risks and opportunities at board- and management-level. The company highlights that climate is integrated into existing systems and processes around risks and opportunities and notes that its board engage with climate issues in training programmes. Deutsche Telekom , The 2019 Financial Year – As part of its non-financial statement, the company details its strategic and organisational approach to climate and wider sustainability issues in a clear and succinct manner (pgs. 80-1). The disclosure identifies the board-level oversight and explains how policies and strategies are managed at a group-level with the involvement of different business units and mechanisms in place for guarantees. The disclosure further sets out the control mechanisms for climate-related and wider sustainability data for targets and indicators.2. Application guidance REQ-01 Governance Disclosures shall describe the governance of environmental policies, strategy and information Disclosure checklist Does the disclosure: Identify the person(s) or committee responsible for climate policies, strategy and information? Explain how climate policies, strategy and information are delegated to management? Describe any systems for accountability and incentivisation? Explain whether the governance mechanisms for climate policies, strategies and disclosure differ from other material concerns and, if so, why? 1. Governance arrangements and rationale Governance disclosures should demonstrate transparency and accountability for the company’s oversight of climate-related matters. Essential is the identification of those with ultimate responsibility for the disclosure of climate-related information, whether that is the CEO or a specific committee or similar. The most innovative, far-reaching and successful climate strategies will often require the leadership or integral support of the highest governing bodies of a company. Illustrating for investors, whether diagrammatically or through clear narrative, where responsibility lies at board-level and who is driving forward such strategies at the management level is essential to evidence clear accountability and provide transparency. It could assist report users to understand the decision-making processes for major strategic decisions. For instance, what processes would allow or require governance bodies to decide to allocate capital, change strategic direction or transform the business model in response to identified climate-related risks and opportunities? In setting out the governance and management arrangements for climate-related policies, strategies and targets, companies should explain the rationale for such arrangements. For example, at a board-level, what qualifications, skills or experience makes the person or members of a committee best suited to overseeing the company’s climate strategy? Indeed, some boards and management teams will draw on external expert advice on general or specific climate-related issues for capacity building and steering. For example, capacity building sessions could be especially appropriate for companies using climate scenario analysis to drive strategy development. Offering details of such external, expert advice in the mainstream report could demonstrate proactive and responsive oversight of climate. 2. Information flows and oversight Effective reporting on governance will articulate to investors the connections, information flows and oversight mechanisms that exist between the board, management and climate-related issues. For example, report users may wish to know by what means and how often the appropriate board members are informed by management on targets, progress or relevant changes to the external environment and through the supply chain. Which corporate governance codes determine or influence the way in which the company is governed? Where appropriate, are there means for responsive strategic interventions or systems in place to ensure resilience? How often does the whole board discuss the climate strategy and consider developments in climate-related risks and opportunities? These are just four questions that reporting on the governance of material climate-related issues could answer to demonstrate that the appropriate organisational and information systems are in place to oversee climate-related risks and opportunities.',\n",

Describe the climate policies and strategies as well as how they support or link to the company’s overall strategies? Detail the resourcing of the delivery and management of climate policies and strategies? Set out the targets, timelines and indicators for delivery of climate policy and strategy been with methods and baselines, as well as explain progress or developments? 1. Natural capital dependencies The report user should be able to understand how the renewable and non-renewable resources and earth systems, such as the climate, which underpin and support the company’s ability to succeed, are reflected in its ambitions in meeting climate-related issues. Therefore, it is helpful where companies detail their natural capital dependencies. The thinking and guidance in the Natural Capital Protocol9 and International <IR> Framework ,10 for example, may benefit report preparers in understanding and reporting these dependencies. While this Guidance is focused on climate, it acknowledges that climate risks and opportunities are inherently interconnected with other environmental issues, such as water stress and deforestation. This natural capital contextualisation offers a company the opportunity to:• Explore risks and opportunities emerging from interconnections and relationships between different environmental issues; • Explain to investors its place in the complex web of natural systems; and • Consider how to integrate learnings from interconnections into risk management, strategy and performance. 2. Policies and strategies Report users should be able to understand how the risk and opportunities identified by companies are reflected in strategic development and how they affect ongoing natural capital dependency and climate ambitions. It may be beneficial to offer further justification in the report, setting out the reasoning behind the adoption of such policies and strategies, explaining how they respond effectively to issues raised in risk and opportunity analysis, dependencies and ambitions. Where policies, strategies and targets have been adopted to deliver climate- related risk reduction, these should be explained and appropriately connected with other climate disclosures, such as the risk management processes. If these strategies and targets have been developed in connection to important agreements or policies (such as the Paris Agreement or a national decarbonisation pathways) or sectoral and climate programmes (such as Science Based Targets) then the importance and relevance to the company should be explained. When adopting and reporting on the details of the policies, strategies and targets for material climate issues, considerations of geography and time should be central. Climate-related risks and opportunities vary greatly according to location and time horizon. For example, some climate- related regulations are more likely in one country than another at any point in time, and the nature and severity of climate impacts, such as extreme weather and temperature increases, will vary significantly between regions. For effective climate action and reporting, corporate policies, strategies and targets should 9 Capitals Coalition (2016) Natural Capital Protocol. [Online].

Where these climate strategies and targets interact with other environmental or social policies, report preparers should draw users’ attention to potential or existing synergies, explaining the benefits and/or feedbacks. 3. Targets and timelines Detailed and consistent disclosure is especially important for the reporting of corporate targets, timelines and indicators for measuring performance against climate policies and strategies. The type of target and indicator, the base and timeline, and the scope should be clearly described to investors and connected with the overall strategy. For example, if a company has adopted a net zero carbon pledge for 2050, useful supporting information would include absolute GHG emissions metrics, indicators, milestones and targets up to 2050, and details of how business operations will contribute to the company-wide target. Likewise, it may be beneficial to set timelines according to how the company has defined the short-, medium- and long-term in its risk and outlook analyses. Progress towards targets may be expressed in terms of reducing negative impacts, but also through more proactive targets, such as value of green investments, percentage of research and development that is low-carbon focused, or numbers of renewable purchase power agreements. Targets such as these provide greater connectivity to financial and core business performance. As a company progresses with its climate strategies and policies, it is beneficial to explain how it is advancing and what factors have been intrinsic to achieving or surpassing the targets. More importantly, where it is the case that indicators or targets have been or are likely to be missed, this should be rationalised, detailing factors that were significant and explaining what could have been and could not be controlled or better managed. Explaining how strategies will be adapted to improve performance as a result would be of particular importance to report users.4. Resourcing Finally, when reporting on climate-related policies, strategies and targets, companies should set out the resourcing, both financial and personnel, for meeting the delivery of the climate policies and strategy. Again, such detail in an annual report can offer investors reassurance of the company’s commitment and effort to meeting its climate ambitions. Reporting on resourcing is especially important if the company’s strategy requires significant capital investment or operation reorganisation to meet its ambitions. Useful resources Capitals Coalition , Natural Capital Protocol – Steps 2, 3 and 4 of the Protocol will assist companies in understanding their natural capital dependencies (and impacts), providing a basis for developing effective climate-related policies, strategies and targets.

Climate risks and opportunities can be complex and have distinctive features, including that they vary with time, are shaped by uncertain actions of many different actors, and follow pathways that can be non-linear. These risks and opportunities are also highly specific to the company, its sector, operations and supply chain.

       " 'CDSB Framework 19 CDSB Framework 18 CDSB Framework | Application guidance for climate-related disclosures 19 CDSB Framework | Application guidance for climate-related disclosures Like the other risks and opportunities that companies face in the modern, interconnected era, those related to climate change require careful consideration, across different time horizons and potential future pathways. For this reason, risk management approaches, horizon scanning, forecasting, sensitivity testing and scenario analysis, which is discussed further below in relation to REQ-06, are amongst the practical tools that can guide companies in their assessment of risk and opportunities. 1. Detailing risks and opportunities When reporting material climate-related risks and opportunities in the mainstream report, thoroughly describing and detailing them, specifying the key characteristics of the risk or opportunity and explaining its relevance to the company and its operations, offers useful information. In terms of characteristics for high quality reporting, it is essential to properly account for where the risk or opportunity may materialise, specifying whether it concerns a specific business area, a particular region of operations or along the supply chain, for instance. Given the variability and complexity of climate issues over different time horizons, it is important for companies to explain the timeframes of risks and opportunities, highlighting when they could be expected to materialise and how they may develop through time. Where climate-related risks intersect with other business and environmental risks in amplifying manners, it is prudent for companies to identify and explain such connections and feedbacks. 2. Quantification and financial impact As well as describing the key details and relevance of the material climate-related risks and opportunities, decision-useful disclosures will further set out the business implications and, where possible, quantify the risks and opportunities over appropriate timeframes. When valuing the risks or opportunities, the reader should be offered the assumptions and essential figures (e.g. present value of asset or revenue stream affected) as well as the uncertainties for the financial figure, especially if the size of the risk or opportunity varies largely over time. In addition, the mainstream report should be designed in a manner that allows the reader to navigate from these risks and opportunities to the policies and strategies developed to manage them, as is expected from REQ-02. 3. Connecting information In addition, while the CDSB Framework does not set out specific reporting requirements, Principle 3 encourages companies to explain whether and to what extent climate-related issues are connected with other information and results in the mainstream report, with REQ-03 explaining that links should be made to reporting of processes and systems for risks and opportunities. For example, report users should be able to understand how climate- related issues have been incorporated into existing systems of risk identification and prioritisation and whether the systems have been adapted to accommodate the characteristics of climate-related issues. Important when reporting material climate risks and opportunities is to explain how the company considers short-, medium- and long-term issues in risk management systems. Further, it will be the case that the systems used to identify climate-related risks and opportunities will develop in coming years with greater understanding of climatic, regulatory and technological pathways. Setting out for report users how the company is developing and adapting these systems will demonstrate responsive and effective management.Useful resources Bank of England , Climate change: What are the risks to financial stability? – This short introduction to physical and transition climate risks and their importance to the global economy is a good starting point for those new to these ideas. McKinsey, Climate Risk and Response provides a more in-depth analysis of these risks with helpful case studies, which may also assist in developing disclosures for REQ-06. COSO and WBCSD , Applying enterprise risk management to environmental, social and governance-related risks – Developed by COSO and WBCSD, this guidance offers a thorough and logical process for developing effective risk management processes for climate-related and wider sustainability risks, including identification, prioritisation, and implementing response. Chapter 5 further offers guidance on how to best report on risks and their identification and management. TCFD , Final Report: Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures – The TCFD recommendations offer an in-depth set of disclosures for material climate-related risks and opportunities and their governance and management. Section C offers recommended disclosures and guidance which may assist companies in developing decision-useful reporting for REQ-03 as well as the other reporting requirements of the CDSB Framework. Examples of good practice AXA , Universal Registration Document 2019 – As well as setting out its climate-related risks with its other material risks, AXA offers further detail of its physical and transition climate-related risks in the corporate responsibility portion of its annual report (pgs. 411-20).

Provide explanations of climate impact metrics including the methodologies used, levels of uncertainty and appropriate narrative to assist understanding of results? Categorise and disaggregate metrics to support understanding and comparability? 1. Material sources of climate impact As well as expecting companies to report their targets and indicators for material climate- related issues, the CDSB Framework sets out that companies should disclose their results for material sources of climate-related impacts in their mainstream reports. Principle 1 of the CDSB Framework offers companies a means to assist them in identifying relevant and then material environmental information, including sources of impact. In addition, the CDSB Framework takes the position that Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions of the company should be regarded as material and included in the mainstream report. It will often be the case that the material sources of climate impact will reflect the natural capital dependencies, risks and opportunities, and ambitions that drive the formation of policies, strategies and targets for climate issues. However, where it is necessary for clarity, the results should be accompanied by an explanation of the materiality of the source of climate impact to the company. It might be that companies are disclosing on material sources of environmental impact in their sustainability reports, CDP responses or index questionnaires. Such disclosures can be repurposed to be included in the mainstream report and satisfy REQ-04 of the CDSB Framework. Table 2 offers an example set of common potential sources of climate impact. 2. Decision-useful information When reporting results on material sources of climate impact, it should be considered what constitutes decision-useful information – consistency, comparability, clarity and verifiability – as set out in Principles 4, 5 and 6 of the CDSB Framework. In satisfying these key characteristics, the applicability of the metrics and indicators chosen to report on material sources of climate impact, such as sector or industry and/or national standards for reporting, should be considered. In addition, results should be reported in absolute and intensity terms, with company revenue and/or appropriate non- financial output measures (e.g. emissions per a standard unit of product) being used to normalise the results. Further, companies should ensure that they do not conflate their results for material sources of climate impact with possible mitigation activities, such as carbon offsetting schemes. The latter should be reported where relevant and material, but in a manner that is distinct from the material sources of impact, otherwise it may mislead the report user. 3. Disaggregation and categorisation To benefit comparability and understandability, it can be helpful to disaggregate and categorise results in terms of geography and business activity to better appreciate impact and report these alongside total results. For instance, if the majority of deforestation and land use change in production, and therefore GHG emissions, occurs within a country with threatened biodiversity, then it is important for investors to understand this differentiation of impact. In the reporting of their material sources of climate impact results, it is beneficial to report users to offer brief explanations to the appropriateness of reporting choices for metrics, intensity factors and means of disaggregation. Given that it is common for selective reporting on corporate impact, such explanations offer further confidence in the data disclosed. In addition, setting out clearly the methodologies used for preparation of disclosures will add to the validity and usefulness of the results. Where there are uncertainties and gaps in the climate data or where methods and assumptions have been amended, highlighting and offering an explanation to report users for these differences can alleviate confusions or misconceptions. Sources of climate impact Description Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions Defined as material for all companies by the CDSB Framework, Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions are all the direct emissions from the company or under its control (Scope 1) and the indirect emissions from energy purchased and used by the company or those under its control (Scope 2). Scope 3 GHG emissions Scope 3 GHG emissions collects all other indirect emissions from the activities of the company from sources that they do not own or control, both upstream and downstream (e.g. purchased goods and use of sold products, respectively). Non-/Renewable energy generation, use and consumptionElectricity and heat production are among the largest contributor to GHG emissions. Electricity generation will need to expand and switch to renewable sources for decarbonisation. Transportation Transportation contributes a significant proportion to annual GHG emissions and is a key area for global efforts to disassociate economic growth from GHG emissions, with different transition pathways expected for each form. Land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) Land use, change and forestry are key sources of emissions and LULUCF is part of international GHG inventories, capturing both the addition and withdrawal of GHGs that land can facilitate. Water use and reuse Global warming will exacerbate and expand areas of water stress, putting supplies at risk for people and business.

The company summarises its performance on climate impact with five metrics, three of which are externally assured, as well as providing its Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions in totals and appropriately categorised. These results are presented with narrative that explains performance and provides targets. In addition, the company directs users to supplementary data and information sources outside the mainstream report. BASF , BASF Report 2019 – As part of its management report, BASF offers a clear set of results for its climate impact. The company presents its Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions with clear reference to methods used as well as presenting offsetting and biomass measures separately. The company further presents data on energy and electricity supply, aggregating these according to source, and water use and stress. These results are all reported with explanations that consistently connect to the strategy and targets of the company.Useful resources CDP, Corporate Climate Change, Forests and Water Security Questionnaires – Many of the world’s largest companies already disclose information and data to CDP annually on material sources of climate impact. CDP submissions can provide a useful, well-structured basis for developing mainstream disclosures in response to REQ-04 as well as other reporting requirements of the CDSB Framework, such as on governance, strategies and targets, and outlook. The GHG Protocol Initiative , The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard – The GHG Protocol’s corporate standard offers a set of requirements and accompanying guidance for developing and reporting GHG inventories for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, which are material for all companies implementing the CDSB Framework. The GHG Protocol have also developed calculator tools for companies as well as a corporate value chain standard for Scope 3 GHG emissions. SASB , SASB Industry Standards – SASB creates industry-specific standards that identify a base set of material sustainability issues for each industry, providing metrics for reporting on them in a consistent and comparable manner. SASB has found climate to be material in 72 of 79 industries.

Where changes are made to methods, restatements should be produced, as in REQ-10 of the CDSB Framework, to draw attention to these changes and an explanation offered. Where targets have been set for material sources of climate impact, it is useful to restate the overall ambition and the baseline, clarifying for the reader as to whether the targets are part of a corporate initiative or scheme, or tied to wider national or international ambitions. Such targets offer an effective means of providing a narrative analysis of performance to reduce climate impact. In explaining trends, companies should draw the reader’s attention to the impacts of environmental initiatives, wider corporate developments, regulatory changes and factors outside the control of the company. For example, a spike in energy usage might be the result of a significant acquisition, or a significant drop in Scope 2 GHG emissions could come as a result of the onboarding of renewable energy in the grid. Such narratives, then, should try to illustrate a more total climate impact, making connections across different aspects of the corporate report in so doing. To offer report users proper comparability between past and present performance on material sources of climate impact, companies need to ensure that they are offering an appropriate number of historical datapoints. Principle 2 of the CDSB Framework sets out that disclosures should include “all information that is necessary for an understanding of the matter that it purports to represent and does not leave out details that could cause information to be false or misleading to users.” Narrow dataset windows or intermittent, longer-term datasets are unsuitable for comparison and decision-making, for instance, potentially obscuring the actual trends of impact. As an example, short-term perspectives on Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions might conceal a trend of emissions shifting from Scope 1 and 2 to 3. For some, such longer-term measures of impact and performance will not be possible for not having collected the data for long enough, which should be explained where it hinders report users. In addition, consistency needs to be applied to techniques used for data gathering and processing to allow for proper comparability and understanding of performance. In many Useful resources WBCSD and PwC , Enhancing the credibility of non-financial information: the investor perspective – This report brings together learnings from investor roundtables and interviews to assist companies in developing decision-useful disclosures. The advice is particularly helpful for metrics and targets, but is very much applicable to all climate-related disclosures. ESG and climate Indexes (e.g. FTSE Russell, MSCI, Sustainalytics, Vigeo Eiris) – Many companies already disclose climate-related information to indexes that are designed to solicit investor-useful information and data. Considering the different requirements and characteristics of quantitative and qualitative information for such submissions may be useful in developing mainstream climate- related disclosures.',\n",
       " 'CDSB Framework 25 CDSB Framework 24 CDSB Framework | Application guidance for climate-related disclosures 25 CDSB Framework | Application guidance for climate-related disclosures Examples of good practice Stora Enso , Annual Report 2019 – In the sustainability section of its mainstream report (pgs. 44-6), Stora Enso presents its GHG emissions results, absolute and normalised, and offers a long-term perspective on its performance with over 10 years of historical data. In addition, the company contextualises its results by presenting them alongside decarbonisation pathways of its sector for two climate scenarios - 2°C and well below 2°C. In doing so, the disclosure offers investors both internal and external comparability. The company further explains the factors that have contributed to its performance and the efforts being taken forward to continue GHG reductions in the coming years to meet targets. Eni, Annual Report 2019 – In its annual report, Eni includes a section detailing its long-term ambitions for carbon neutrality (pgs. 111-5), which presents the company’s climate-related results. The thorough suite of results is presented together for easy understanding and comparison, with total and normalised data reported with two years of historical results. The results are presented with a clear commentary that articulately connects the performance and development with the company’s ambitions and targets, providing report users with detailed commentary on specific geographies and business areas affecting results. REQ-06 Outlook Management shall summarise their conclusions about the effect of environmental impacts, risks and opportunities on the organisation’s future performance and position Disclosure checklist Does the disclosure: Explain the likely effect of future climate- related impacts, risks and opportunities on company performance, taking account of regulatory and market trends? Identify and explain the time horizons used for reporting on corporate outlook? Explain any techniques, such as scenario analysis, used to inform the outlook including the methods, scenarios and assumptions used, and any shortcomings and uncertainties?will affect, its ability to execute its strategy, innovate and create value across time horizons. The information provided in response to REQ- 06 should synthesise and build on what has been disclosed in line with the first five reporting requirements of the CDSB Framework, providing a picture for investors of how climate-related issues will likely affect the company’s performance and position. Taking into account the timescales over which climate change will manifest itself, the non-linear and potentially abrupt nature of possible impact, and the multiple, interconnecting systems that drive climate-related risks and opportunities for companies, scenario analysis is a particularly useful method for companies to better understand potential futures, respond to and disclose such information to investors. Scenario analysis is a key tool to assess and build resilience within environmental, economic and social systems that are in flux. 1. Scenario analysis Scenario analysis can be conducted through different routes including consultation with company and external experts or scientific analysis. There is no special or correct formula by which it is to be completed. Instead, it is a process to analyse a suite of potential futures, REQ-06 of the CDSB Framework encourages companies to provide a future-oriented summary that enables report users to understand how a company’s climate-related risks, opportunities and impacts are affecting, or understanding the company, its dependencies and strategic resilience, within the different forces that drive each of the futures. Some will do this through quantitative modelling, others will not. For climate-related issues, assessing a range of future climate states, taking into account a range of different warming levels (e.g. 1.5, 2, 3 and greater than 4°C) and transition pathways (e.g. drastic to 1.5°C, relatively more gradual 2°C, technologically-enabled 1.5°C) will elicit important information for companies and report users. The scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA) are used by governments and regulators around the world, and therefore offer a reliable basis for companies to consider their potential futures. The use of scenario analysis will be based on iterative learning and development. This will allow companies to build on findings or methods employed previously as well as incorporate more up-to-date understanding of climate change, other environmental systems and their interactions as well as greater comprehension of climate resilient pathways. If using scenario analysis, then report preparers should be open with these aspects of learning and development. 2. Methods, assumptions and uncertainties In reporting on corporate outlook, report users should be able to understand the different methods that have been used to prepare the outlook, including horizon scanning and scenario analysis, any assumptions made and the timeframes over which the analysis has been completed. These different characteristics of the scenarios should reflect the nature of the company, its assets and operations, and the scale of risks and opportunities already identified. In addition, where external advice or assistance on conducting scenario analysis is used, it is beneficial for this to be highlighted within the methods and inputs. In reporting the effectiveness and resilience of the company’s strategies to the potential business impacts of the different scenarios, report preparers should be clear about uncertainties but as precise as possible with how the impacts of risks differ by geography, operations and time horizon. Clear articulation of the specific sensitivities to the different scenarios will allow report users to better understand the potential responses identified by the company as a result of the exercise, whether that is no response, changes to financial planning and investment, or reimagining the business model. 3. Iteration and learning Climate-related risks and opportunities are highly dynamic and dependent upon changes in complex climate systems and political, economic and societal arenas as well as the exposure of the company or asset and its associated vulnerabilities.11 The qualities and dimensions of climate-related risks and opportunities for companies are likely to change over time, whether gradually or abruptly. Given this, using the findings of such exercises to assess corporate outlook are an important means of updating risk and opportunity identification systems and refine or reformulate climate-related policies, strategies and targets. This will better prepare the company in limiting and seizing climate-related risks and opportunities. Including such learnings and how they have been incorporated into systems and ambitions in the mainstream report is a valuable means of demonstrating effective and efficient management of material climate-related matters to investors. 11 David Viner et al (2020) Understanding the dynamic nature of risk in climate change assessments — A new starting point for discussion.

Important considerations While the Climate Guidance has focused on the first six reporting requirements of the CDSB Framework, companies should not mistake the importance of the remaining six reporting requirements, which are essential to completeness. In addition, when developing material climate disclosures, companies should ensure that the seven guiding principles of the CDSB Framework are followed to ensure high-quality, decision-useful reporting. Below, we draw attention to three, more particular considerations to assist report preparers in developing mainstream climate disclosures in line with the CDSB Framework. 1. Relevance and materiality When seeking to use the climate-related guidance offered for REQ-01 to REQ-06 of the CDSB Framework, companies must ensure that the principles of relevance and materiality have been applied. The Climate Guidance is designed for companies who have identified climate- related risks and opportunities as material, but not all of the suggested reporting practices offered will necessarily be applicable for inclusion in the mainstream report of all companies that have deemed climate material. The reporting practices of the Climate Guidance should be applied and disclosed against, like all information for the mainstream report, when the information is deemed material by the company. Principle 1 of the CDSB Framework offers that information is material if: • The impacts or results it describes are, due to their size and nature, expected to have a significant positive or negative impact on the company’s financial condition and operational results and its ability to execute its strategy; or • Omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence the decisions that users of mainstream reports make on the basis of that mainstream report, which provides information about a specific reporting company.REQ-11 of the CDSB Framework encourages companies include a statement of conformance, setting out the extent that the principles and reporting requirements of the CDSB Framework have been applied. In doing so, companies are expected to state the outcome of applying the relevance and materiality principle. 2. Reporting boundaries and periods REQ-07 of the CDSB Framework concerns the reporting boundaries employed by the company for the mainstream report. The CDSB Framework holds that the material climate- related information disclosed should be prepared according to the reporting boundaries used for the rest of the mainstream report. It may, however, be that climate-related information that falls outside this reporting boundary will be appropriate for inclusion in the mainstream report, such as relating to outsourced activities or where contracts expose a company to climate-related risks or opportunities. A common example of this is Scope 3 GHG emissions. REQ-07 of the CDSB Framework offers that information and data from outside the reporting boundary should be distinguished and the company’s approach to boundary setting be reported. More information on boundary setting and reporting can be found in CDSB’s Proposals for boundary setting in the mainstream report (see Appendix 3). In addition to the reporting boundary, REQ-09 of the CDSB Framework suggests that the material climate-related information and data included in the mainstream report should follow the reporting period of the rest of the report. Aligning the reporting period of the climate- related information included in the mainstream report better ensures that it can be connected with the other information disclosed, such as financial performance and other environmental data, and so enhance comparability, as advocated by Principles 3 and 4, respectively, of the CDSB Framework. 3. Using existing disclosures and resources The CDSB Framework and its reporting requirements intend to align with and',\n",
       " 'CDSB Framework 28 CDSB Framework | Application guidance for climate-related disclosures complement existing mainstream financial disclosures. It will be the case, then, that companies may already satisfy certain aspects of the reporting requirements of the CDSB Framework and the suggestions of Climate Guidance. Principle 3 of the CDSB Framework emphasises the importance of ensuring that material environmental disclosures, including those regarding climate issues, are connected with other mainstream disclosures. The principle informs report preparers that disclosures should be formulated and positioned in a way to allow investors to see and understand the linkages. In developing their mainstream reporting practices, companies should try and ensure that the language and labelling used best allows for clear understanding of these interconnections and avoids unnecessary duplication or confusion of information. In addition, companies may already be disclosing material climate information that would be appropriate for mainstream disclosure in line with the CDSB Framework through different reporting channels, such as in sustainability reports, CDP submissions and index or investor questionnaires. Repurposing these existing disclosures to meet the specific requirements of the mainstream report could benefit and streamline reporting practices. Similarly, report preparers may also be able to use the financial accounting standards used for its mainstream reporting to report on certain aspects of climate-related financial information, which is further explored in CDSB’s Uncharted waters (see Appendix 3).

Key characteristics These considerations highlight key characteristics of climate change that are important for companies to properly comprehend and consider as they seek to understand climate-related risks and opportunities, develop strategies, and act to implement them. Firstly, the climate change effects felt by companies are the result of a complexly interconnecting system of environmental, social and economic factors. Developing effective and resilient climate strategies, then, requires companies to take account of many different, changing and interconnecting systems. Secondly, the complex nature of the climate system and its interplays with other environmental systems means that climate change impacts are not always linear in nature. Feedback loops within the climate system, factors of inertia, and the potential for tipping points and irreversibility, mean that the full nature and scale of climate change is uncertain and dynamic. These characteristics of climate change necessitate that companies think in an integrated manner, taking account of a wide range of possible global, regional and local impacts that can be generated by climate change, and act with proper appreciation. Thirdly, and finally, while some impacts of climate change are certain, others are more uncertain, with varying ranges of potential outcomes over differing timescales and with differing likelihoods. The physical and transition risks and opportunities relevant to a business are unique to each company and highly dynamic. This means that considerations of climate change and its potential impacts must be a permanent fixture of corporate thinking for the decades to come, requiring continued iteration in strategies and targets to reflect scientific, economic, technological or regulatory developments. In coming years, it appears near inevitable that there will be a policy response to climate change that mainstreams and makes mandatory the disclosure of climate-related governance, management and strategy, risks and opportunities, and outlooks.8 This Climate Guidance used alongside the CDSB Framework encourages companies to report effectively and efficiently on material climate-related information in order to provide investors with useful and reliable climate-related information to drive their capital allocations. 8 UN PRI (2019) The Inevitable Policy Response: Preparing financial markets for climate-related policy/regulatory risks. [PDF]. Available from: https:/ /www.unpri.org/download?ac=9833The World Economic Forum’s 2020 Global Risk Report illustrates succinctly the scale of the potential impact of climate change on the world’s social and economic systems.4 Climate action failure is listed as the risk with the greatest potential for global impact as well as being placed at second in terms of likelihood. Climate change, then, is a risk that no country, business or person can ignore or avoid, whether that is from action or inaction. On the basis of current policy commitments to combat climate change, it is estimated that the world will experience 3°C of warming by 2100,5 double the global temperature increase the Paris Agreement encourages countries to strive for. Significantly, carbon emissions continue to rise.6 To limit warming to 1.5°C, the UN Environment Programme has estimated an annual 7.6% reduction in emissions is required from 2020, necessitating “fundamental structural changes” to the global economy.7 1. Physical and transition risks For companies, climate-related risks can be understood in two general fields – physical risks and transition risks. The former gathers together the risks posed to businesses from the potential impacts of a warming climate system as well as the subsequent impacts of those changes on other environmental systems and resources. Physical risks therefore encapsulate increased likelihood and severity of extreme weather events, sea-level rise, expansion and exacerbation of water stress, ecosystem change and biodiversity loss, for instance. Transition risks, on the other hand, denote those corporate risks that are associated with the regulatory, economic and societal changes undertaken to try and limit global warming, primarily through efforts to decarbonise economic and social activity. Corporate transition risks include the impact of regulation to stem emissions, shifts in market preferences and the impact of new technologies, to offer three examples. These transition risks, though, are mirrored by a range of corporate opportunities that come with decarbonisation, such as resource efficiency and new products and services. While it is helpful to consider the corporate impact of climate change through these two risk lenses, in actuality, whichever trajectory the world or nations follow, companies will have to navigate, manage and seize an assemblage of physical and transition risks and opportunities. For example, if we meet the ambitions of limiting warming to 1.5°C through economic and societal transformation, global warming will still affect the climate system, exacerbating risks and stresses felt by peoples and companies around the world. Indeed, it must be remembered that limiting global warming to 1.5°C will still result in regional and local warming patterns far greater than 1.5°C and impacts at an elevated state. 4 World Economic Forum (2020) Global Risk Report 2020.

Incentivisation Incentivising appropriate members of the board and management for meeting and fulfilling climate-related targets and policies is a means of fostering ownership of performance, and reporting on such arrangements in the mainstream report is a means of communicating that commitment. Equally important, though, is the reporting of the metrics or criteria used in incentive schemes. They should speak to the most pertinent risks, opportunities and impacts that have been identified by the company for climate-related issues. For example, it may be more appropriate for a bank to tie its climate incentives to performance on green financing than Scope 1 GHG emissions. Providing ongoing disclosure about performance and progress towards long-term targets tied to remuneration is useful. 4. Specificity of climate governance Companies’ climate efforts sometimes form part of broader, cross-cutting environmental strategies with governance and oversight organised around these broader, interconnected environmental ambitions. However, different investors can focus their attention on different material environmental issues when assessing companies and reading reports, with climate change often of particular importance. As such, companies should strive to be as explicit as possible in detailing their governance of climate- related issues if part of a more connected, environmental strategy.Useful resources Commonwealth Climate and Law Initiative , The climate risk reporting journey: A corporate governance primer – This primer, which has been designed for corporate boards or responsible committees, offers a set of important questions to guide the oversight and governance processes for material climate-related information. This will be particularly valuable to companies starting on their disclosure journey. World Economic Forum, How to Set Up Effective Climate Governance on Corporate Boards: Guiding principles and questions – This guide from the World Economic Forum offers boards eight principles for effective governance, with each accompanied by guiding questions. As well as assisting the development of good governance, the principles and questions offer key areas to consider in developing their governance disclosures for climate-related issues. WBCSD , Modernizing Governance: ESG challenges and recommendations for corporate directors – These recommendations from WBCSD for developing governance practices to meet the challenges of sustainability offers a useful basis for developing oversight practices around material climate issues. The points raised in Sections 4, 5 and 6 provide helpful considerations for developing governance disclosures. Examples of good practice Aviva , Annual Report and Accounts 2019 – In its annual report, Aviva offers a specific section for climate-related financial disclosures (pgs. 51-3). In a short governance disclosure, the company identifies those responsible for climate-related risks and opportunities at board- and management-level. The company highlights that climate is integrated into existing systems and processes around risks and opportunities and notes that its board engage with climate issues in training programmes. Deutsche Telekom , The 2019 Financial Year – As part of its non-financial statement, the company details its strategic and organisational approach to climate and wider sustainability issues in a clear and succinct manner (pgs. 80-1). The disclosure identifies the board-level oversight and explains how policies and strategies are managed at a group-level with the involvement of different business units and mechanisms in place for guarantees. The disclosure further sets out the control mechanisms for climate-related and wider sustainability data for targets and indicators.2. Application guidance REQ-01 Governance Disclosures shall describe the governance of environmental policies, strategy and information Disclosure checklist Does the disclosure: Identify the person(s) or committee responsible for climate policies, strategy and information? Explain how climate policies, strategy and information are delegated to management? Describe any systems for accountability and incentivisation? Explain whether the governance mechanisms for climate policies, strategies and disclosure differ from other material concerns and, if so, why? 1. Governance arrangements and rationale Governance disclosures should demonstrate transparency and accountability for the company’s oversight of climate-related matters. Essential is the identification of those with ultimate responsibility for the disclosure of climate-related information, whether that is the CEO or a specific committee or similar. The most innovative, far-reaching and successful climate strategies will often require the leadership or integral support of the highest governing bodies of a company. Illustrating for investors, whether diagrammatically or through clear narrative, where responsibility lies at board-level and who is driving forward such strategies at the management level is essential to evidence clear accountability and provide transparency. It could assist report users to understand the decision-making processes for major strategic decisions. For instance, what processes would allow or require governance bodies to decide to allocate capital, change strategic direction or transform the business model in response to identified climate-related risks and opportunities? In setting out the governance and management arrangements for climate-related policies, strategies and targets, companies should explain the rationale for such arrangements. For example, at a board-level, what qualifications, skills or experience makes the person or members of a committee best suited to overseeing the company’s climate strategy? Indeed, some boards and management teams will draw on external expert advice on general or specific climate-related issues for capacity building and steering. For example, capacity building sessions could be especially appropriate for companies using climate scenario analysis to drive strategy development. Offering details of such external, expert advice in the mainstream report could demonstrate proactive and responsive oversight of climate. 2. Information flows and oversight Effective reporting on governance will articulate to investors the connections, information flows and oversight mechanisms that exist between the board, management and climate-related issues. For example, report users may wish to know by what means and how often the appropriate board members are informed by management on targets, progress or relevant changes to the external environment and through the supply chain. Which corporate governance codes determine or influence the way in which the company is governed? Where appropriate, are there means for responsive strategic interventions or systems in place to ensure resilience? How often does the whole board discuss the climate strategy and consider developments in climate-related risks and opportunities? These are just four questions that reporting on the governance of material climate-related issues could answer to demonstrate that the appropriate organisational and information systems are in place to oversee climate-related risks and opportunities.',\n",
       " 'CDSB Framework 15 CDSB Framework 14 CDSB Framework | Application guidance for climate-related disclosures 15 CDSB Framework | Application guidance for climate-related disclosures REQ-02 Management’s environmental policies, strategy and targets Disclosures shall report management’s environmental policies, strategy and targets, including the indicators, plans and timelines used to assess performance Disclosure checklist Does the disclosure: Explain the climate-related natural capital dependencies of the company? Describe the climate policies and strategies as well as how they support or link to the company’s overall strategies? Detail the resourcing of the delivery and management of climate policies and strategies? Set out the targets, timelines and indicators for delivery of climate policy and strategy been with methods and baselines, as well as explain progress or developments? 1. Natural capital dependencies The report user should be able to understand how the renewable and non-renewable resources and earth systems, such as the climate, which underpin and support the company’s ability to succeed, are reflected in its ambitions in meeting climate-related issues. Therefore, it is helpful where companies detail their natural capital dependencies. The thinking and guidance in the Natural Capital Protocol9 and International <IR> Framework ,10 for example, may benefit report preparers in understanding and reporting these dependencies. While this Guidance is focused on climate, it acknowledges that climate risks and opportunities are inherently interconnected with other environmental issues, such as water stress and deforestation. This natural capital contextualisation offers a company the opportunity to:• Explore risks and opportunities emerging from interconnections and relationships between different environmental issues; • Explain to investors its place in the complex web of natural systems; and • Consider how to integrate learnings from interconnections into risk management, strategy and performance. 2. Policies and strategies Report users should be able to understand how the risk and opportunities identified by companies are reflected in strategic development and how they affect ongoing natural capital dependency and climate ambitions. It may be beneficial to offer further justification in the report, setting out the reasoning behind the adoption of such policies and strategies, explaining how they respond effectively to issues raised in risk and opportunity analysis, dependencies and ambitions. Where policies, strategies and targets have been adopted to deliver climate- related risk reduction, these should be explained and appropriately connected with other climate disclosures, such as the risk management processes. If these strategies and targets have been developed in connection to important agreements or policies (such as the Paris Agreement or a national decarbonisation pathways) or sectoral and climate programmes (such as Science Based Targets) then the importance and relevance to the company should be explained. When adopting and reporting on the details of the policies, strategies and targets for material climate issues, considerations of geography and time should be central. Climate-related risks and opportunities vary greatly according to location and time horizon. For example, some climate- related regulations are more likely in one country than another at any point in time, and the nature and severity of climate impacts, such as extreme weather and temperature increases, will vary significantly between regions. For effective climate action and reporting, corporate policies, strategies and targets should 9 Capitals Coalition (2016) Natural Capital Protocol. [Online].

Where these climate strategies and targets interact with other environmental or social policies, report preparers should draw users’ attention to potential or existing synergies, explaining the benefits and/or feedbacks. 3. Targets and timelines Detailed and consistent disclosure is especially important for the reporting of corporate targets, timelines and indicators for measuring performance against climate policies and strategies. The type of target and indicator, the base and timeline, and the scope should be clearly described to investors and connected with the overall strategy. For example, if a company has adopted a net zero carbon pledge for 2050, useful supporting information would include absolute GHG emissions metrics, indicators, milestones and targets up to 2050, and details of how business operations will contribute to the company-wide target. Likewise, it may be beneficial to set timelines according to how the company has defined the short-, medium- and long-term in its risk and outlook analyses. Progress towards targets may be expressed in terms of reducing negative impacts, but also through more proactive targets, such as value of green investments, percentage of research and development that is low-carbon focused, or numbers of renewable purchase power agreements. Targets such as these provide greater connectivity to financial and core business performance. As a company progresses with its climate strategies and policies, it is beneficial to explain how it is advancing and what factors have been intrinsic to achieving or surpassing the targets. More importantly, where it is the case that indicators or targets have been or are likely to be missed, this should be rationalised, detailing factors that were significant and explaining what could have been and could not be controlled or better managed. Explaining how strategies will be adapted to improve performance as a result would be of particular importance to report users.4. Resourcing Finally, when reporting on climate-related policies, strategies and targets, companies should set out the resourcing, both financial and personnel, for meeting the delivery of the climate policies and strategy. Again, such detail in an annual report can offer investors reassurance of the company’s commitment and effort to meeting its climate ambitions. Reporting on resourcing is especially important if the company’s strategy requires significant capital investment or operation reorganisation to meet its ambitions. Useful resources Capitals Coalition , Natural Capital Protocol – Steps 2, 3 and 4 of the Protocol will assist companies in understanding their natural capital dependencies (and impacts), providing a basis for developing effective climate-related policies, strategies and targets.

Explain the strategic, geographic, operational, financial and supply chain implications of the climate-related risks and opportunities identified? Describe the systems and processes used for assessing, identifying and monitoring risks and opportunities, including whether they are integrated with existing risk management systems and processes?Climate-related risks and opportunities principally relate to the physical effects of climate change or to the effects of transitioning to a low-carbon economy, which encapsulates, for instance, regulatory, technological, legal and reputational factors. Climate risks and opportunities can be complex and have distinctive features, including that they vary with time, are shaped by uncertain actions of many different actors, and follow pathways that can be non-linear. These risks and opportunities are also highly specific to the company, its sector, operations and supply chain.

       " 'CDSB Framework 19 CDSB Framework 18 CDSB Framework | Application guidance for climate-related disclosures 19 CDSB Framework | Application guidance for climate-related disclosures Like the other risks and opportunities that companies face in the modern, interconnected era, those related to climate change require careful consideration, across different time horizons and potential future pathways. For this reason, risk management approaches, horizon scanning, forecasting, sensitivity testing and scenario analysis, which is discussed further below in relation to REQ-06, are amongst the practical tools that can guide companies in their assessment of risk and opportunities. 1. Detailing risks and opportunities When reporting material climate-related risks and opportunities in the mainstream report, thoroughly describing and detailing them, specifying the key characteristics of the risk or opportunity and explaining its relevance to the company and its operations, offers useful information. In terms of characteristics for high quality reporting, it is essential to properly account for where the risk or opportunity may materialise, specifying whether it concerns a specific business area, a particular region of operations or along the supply chain, for instance. Given the variability and complexity of climate issues over different time horizons, it is important for companies to explain the timeframes of risks and opportunities, highlighting when they could be expected to materialise and how they may develop through time. Where climate-related risks intersect with other business and environmental risks in amplifying manners, it is prudent for companies to identify and explain such connections and feedbacks. 2. Quantification and financial impact As well as describing the key details and relevance of the material climate-related risks and opportunities, decision-useful disclosures will further set out the business implications and, where possible, quantify the risks and opportunities over appropriate timeframes. When valuing the risks or opportunities, the reader should be offered the assumptions and essential figures (e.g. present value of asset or revenue stream affected) as well as the uncertainties for the financial figure, especially if the size of the risk or opportunity varies largely over time. In addition, the mainstream report should be designed in a manner that allows the reader to navigate from these risks and opportunities to the policies and strategies developed to manage them, as is expected from REQ-02. 3. Connecting information In addition, while the CDSB Framework does not set out specific reporting requirements, Principle 3 encourages companies to explain whether and to what extent climate-related issues are connected with other information and results in the mainstream report, with REQ-03 explaining that links should be made to reporting of processes and systems for risks and opportunities. For example, report users should be able to understand how climate- related issues have been incorporated into existing systems of risk identification and prioritisation and whether the systems have been adapted to accommodate the characteristics of climate-related issues. Important when reporting material climate risks and opportunities is to explain how the company considers short-, medium- and long-term issues in risk management systems. Further, it will be the case that the systems used to identify climate-related risks and opportunities will develop in coming years with greater understanding of climatic, regulatory and technological pathways. Setting out for report users how the company is developing and adapting these systems will demonstrate responsive and effective management.Useful resources Bank of England , Climate change: What are the risks to financial stability? – This short introduction to physical and transition climate risks and their importance to the global economy is a good starting point for those new to these ideas. McKinsey, Climate Risk and Response provides a more in-depth analysis of these risks with helpful case studies, which may also assist in developing disclosures for REQ-06. COSO and WBCSD , Applying enterprise risk management to environmental, social and governance-related risks – Developed by COSO and WBCSD, this guidance offers a thorough and logical process for developing effective risk management processes for climate-related and wider sustainability risks, including identification, prioritisation, and implementing response. Chapter 5 further offers guidance on how to best report on risks and their identification and management. TCFD , Final Report: Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures – The TCFD recommendations offer an in-depth set of disclosures for material climate-related risks and opportunities and their governance and management. Section C offers recommended disclosures and guidance which may assist companies in developing decision-useful reporting for REQ-03 as well as the other reporting requirements of the CDSB Framework. Examples of good practice AXA , Universal Registration Document 2019 – As well as setting out its climate-related risks with its other material risks, AXA offers further detail of its physical and transition climate-related risks in the corporate responsibility portion of its annual report (pgs. 411-20). The company explains its processes and modelling to determine climate-related risk and impact, linking this with its broader climate and investment strategy towards a 1.5°C portfolio target. The disclosure is effective in its connection of different disclosure requirements and connecting climate and financial risks. The company further directs users to a more in-depth report that details its methods and analysis of physical and transition risks. Kering , Universal Registration Document 2019 – In the Risk Management section of its registration document, Kering details its risks using icons to depict the probability of occurrence, area of impact, and severity of impact. The corporate risks relating to climate change are detailed on pg. 430, offering the report user the nature and scale of possible impact, case studies to illustrate potential effects, and actions taken to mitigate these risks.

Provide explanations of climate impact metrics including the methodologies used, levels of uncertainty and appropriate narrative to assist understanding of results? Categorise and disaggregate metrics to support understanding and comparability? 1. Material sources of climate impact As well as expecting companies to report their targets and indicators for material climate- related issues, the CDSB Framework sets out that companies should disclose their results for material sources of climate-related impacts in their mainstream reports. Principle 1 of the CDSB Framework offers companies a means to assist them in identifying relevant and then material environmental information, including sources of impact. In addition, the CDSB Framework takes the position that Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions of the company should be regarded as material and included in the mainstream report. It will often be the case that the material sources of climate impact will reflect the natural capital dependencies, risks and opportunities, and ambitions that drive the formation of policies, strategies and targets for climate issues. However, where it is necessary for clarity, the results should be accompanied by an explanation of the materiality of the source of climate impact to the company. It might be that companies are disclosing on material sources of environmental impact in their sustainability reports, CDP responses or index questionnaires. Such disclosures can be repurposed to be included in the mainstream report and satisfy REQ-04 of the CDSB Framework. Table 2 offers an example set of common potential sources of climate impact. 2. Decision-useful information When reporting results on material sources of climate impact, it should be considered what constitutes decision-useful information – consistency, comparability, clarity and verifiability – as set out in Principles 4, 5 and 6 of the CDSB Framework. In satisfying these key characteristics, the applicability of the metrics and indicators chosen to report on material sources of climate impact, such as sector or industry and/or national standards for reporting, should be considered. In addition, results should be reported in absolute and intensity terms, with company revenue and/or appropriate non- financial output measures (e.g. emissions per a standard unit of product) being used to normalise the results. Further, companies should ensure that they do not conflate their results for material sources of climate impact with possible mitigation activities, such as carbon offsetting schemes. The latter should be reported where relevant and material, but in a manner that is distinct from the material sources of impact, otherwise it may mislead the report user. 3. Disaggregation and categorisation To benefit comparability and understandability, it can be helpful to disaggregate and categorise results in terms of geography and business activity to better appreciate impact and report these alongside total results. For instance, if the majority of deforestation and land use change in production, and therefore GHG emissions, occurs within a country with threatened biodiversity, then it is important for investors to understand this differentiation of impact. In the reporting of their material sources of climate impact results, it is beneficial to report users to offer brief explanations to the appropriateness of reporting choices for metrics, intensity factors and means of disaggregation. Given that it is common for selective reporting on corporate impact, such explanations offer further confidence in the data disclosed. In addition, setting out clearly the methodologies used for preparation of disclosures will add to the validity and usefulness of the results. Where there are uncertainties and gaps in the climate data or where methods and assumptions have been amended, highlighting and offering an explanation to report users for these differences can alleviate confusions or misconceptions. Sources of climate impact Description Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions Defined as material for all companies by the CDSB Framework, Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions are all the direct emissions from the company or under its control (Scope 1) and the indirect emissions from energy purchased and used by the company or those under its control (Scope 2). Scope 3 GHG emissions Scope 3 GHG emissions collects all other indirect emissions from the activities of the company from sources that they do not own or control, both upstream and downstream (e.g. purchased goods and use of sold products, respectively). Non-/Renewable energy generation, use and consumptionElectricity and heat production are among the largest contributor to GHG emissions. Electricity generation will need to expand and switch to renewable sources for decarbonisation. Transportation Transportation contributes a significant proportion to annual GHG emissions and is a key area for global efforts to disassociate economic growth from GHG emissions, with different transition pathways expected for each form. Land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) Land use, change and forestry are key sources of emissions and LULUCF is part of international GHG inventories, capturing both the addition and withdrawal of GHGs that land can facilitate. Water use and reuse Global warming will exacerbate and expand areas of water stress, putting supplies at risk for people and business. Table 2 Common examples of sources of climate impact, with a description of each and how they contribute or are connected to climate issues.',\n",

The company summarises its performance on climate impact with five metrics, three of which are externally assured, as well as providing its Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions in totals and appropriately categorised. These results are presented with narrative that explains performance and provides targets. In addition, the company directs users to supplementary data and information sources outside the mainstream report. BASF , BASF Report 2019 – As part of its management report, BASF offers a clear set of results for its climate impact. The company presents its Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions with clear reference to methods used as well as presenting offsetting and biomass measures separately. The company further presents data on energy and electricity supply, aggregating these according to source, and water use and stress. These results are all reported with explanations that consistently connect to the strategy and targets of the company.Useful resources CDP, Corporate Climate Change, Forests and Water Security Questionnaires – Many of the world’s largest companies already disclose information and data to CDP annually on material sources of climate impact. CDP submissions can provide a useful, well-structured basis for developing mainstream disclosures in response to REQ-04 as well as other reporting requirements of the CDSB Framework, such as on governance, strategies and targets, and outlook. The GHG Protocol Initiative , The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard – The GHG Protocol’s corporate standard offers a set of requirements and accompanying guidance for developing and reporting GHG inventories for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, which are material for all companies implementing the CDSB Framework. The GHG Protocol have also developed calculator tools for companies as well as a corporate value chain standard for Scope 3 GHG emissions. SASB , SASB Industry Standards – SASB creates industry-specific standards that identify a base set of material sustainability issues for each industry, providing metrics for reporting on them in a consistent and comparable manner. SASB has found climate to be material in 72 of 79 industries. These metrics could also be beneficial for target setting in REQ-02 as well as for REQ-04.REQ-05 Performance and comparative analysis Disclosures shall include an analysis of the information disclosed in REQ-04 compared with any performance targets set and with results reported in a previous period Disclosure checklist Does the disclosure: Provide appropriate historical data to the results reported from REQ-04 for material climate impact to allow for useful comparison? Contextualise the performance with baselines, targets and other criteria used to assess progress? Explain the major trends with reference to, for example, climate strategies, business developments, or political and economic changes?circumstances, such changes are made to improve accuracy or meet new standards. Where changes are made to methods, restatements should be produced, as in REQ-10 of the CDSB Framework, to draw attention to these changes and an explanation offered. Where targets have been set for material sources of climate impact, it is useful to restate the overall ambition and the baseline, clarifying for the reader as to whether the targets are part of a corporate initiative or scheme, or tied to wider national or international ambitions. Such targets offer an effective means of providing a narrative analysis of performance to reduce climate impact. In explaining trends, companies should draw the reader’s attention to the impacts of environmental initiatives, wider corporate developments, regulatory changes and factors outside the control of the company. For example, a spike in energy usage might be the result of a significant acquisition, or a significant drop in Scope 2 GHG emissions could come as a result of the onboarding of renewable energy in the grid. Such narratives, then, should try to illustrate a more total climate impact, making connections across different aspects of the corporate report in so doing. To offer report users proper comparability between past and present performance on material sources of climate impact, companies need to ensure that they are offering an appropriate number of historical datapoints. Principle 2 of the CDSB Framework sets out that disclosures should include “all information that is necessary for an understanding of the matter that it purports to represent and does not leave out details that could cause information to be false or misleading to users.” Narrow dataset windows or intermittent, longer-term datasets are unsuitable for comparison and decision-making, for instance, potentially obscuring the actual trends of impact. As an example, short-term perspectives on Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions might conceal a trend of emissions shifting from Scope 1 and 2 to 3. For some, such longer-term measures of impact and performance will not be possible for not having collected the data for long enough, which should be explained where it hinders report users. In addition, consistency needs to be applied to techniques used for data gathering and processing to allow for proper comparability and understanding of performance.

In addition, the company contextualises its results by presenting them alongside decarbonisation pathways of its sector for two climate scenarios - 2°C and well below 2°C. In doing so, the disclosure offers investors both internal and external comparability. The company further explains the factors that have contributed to its performance and the efforts being taken forward to continue GHG reductions in the coming years to meet targets. Eni, Annual Report 2019 – In its annual report, Eni includes a section detailing its long-term ambitions for carbon neutrality (pgs. 111-5), which presents the company’s climate-related results.

REQ-06 Outlook Management shall summarise their conclusions about the effect of environmental impacts, risks and opportunities on the organisation’s future performance and position Disclosure checklist Does the disclosure: Explain the likely effect of future climate- related impacts, risks and opportunities on company performance, taking account of regulatory and market trends? Identify and explain the time horizons used for reporting on corporate outlook? Explain any techniques, such as scenario analysis, used to inform the outlook including the methods, scenarios and assumptions used, and any shortcomings and uncertainties?will affect, its ability to execute its strategy, innovate and create value across time horizons. The information provided in response to REQ- 06 should synthesise and build on what has been disclosed in line with the first five reporting requirements of the CDSB Framework, providing a picture for investors of how climate-related issues will likely affect the company’s performance and position. Taking into account the timescales over which climate change will manifest itself, the non-linear and potentially abrupt nature of possible impact, and the multiple, interconnecting systems that drive climate-related risks and opportunities for companies, scenario analysis is a particularly useful method for companies to better understand potential futures, respond to and disclose such information to investors. Scenario analysis is a key tool to assess and build resilience within environmental, economic and social systems that are in flux. 1. Scenario analysis Scenario analysis can be conducted through different routes including consultation with company and external experts or scientific analysis. There is no special or correct formula by which it is to be completed. Instead, it is a process to analyse a suite of potential futures, REQ-06 of the CDSB Framework encourages companies to provide a future-oriented summary that enables report users to understand how a company’s climate-related risks, opportunities and impacts are affecting, or understanding the company, its dependencies and strategic resilience, within the different forces that drive each of the futures. Some will do this through quantitative modelling, others will not. For climate-related issues, assessing a range of future climate states, taking into account a range of different warming levels (e.g. 1.5, 2, 3 and greater than 4°C) and transition pathways (e.g. drastic to 1.5°C, relatively more gradual 2°C, technologically-enabled 1.5°C) will elicit important information for companies and report users. The scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA) are used by governments and regulators around the world, and therefore offer a reliable basis for companies to consider their potential futures. The use of scenario analysis will be based on iterative learning and development. This will allow companies to build on findings or methods employed previously as well as incorporate more up-to-date understanding of climate change, other environmental systems and their interactions as well as greater comprehension of climate resilient pathways. If using scenario analysis, then report preparers should be open with these aspects of learning and development. 2. Methods, assumptions and uncertainties In reporting on corporate outlook, report users should be able to understand the different methods that have been used to prepare the outlook, including horizon scanning and scenario analysis, any assumptions made and the timeframes over which the analysis has been completed. These different characteristics of the scenarios should reflect the nature of the company, its assets and operations, and the scale of risks and opportunities already identified. In addition, where external advice or assistance on conducting scenario analysis is used, it is beneficial for this to be highlighted within the methods and inputs. In reporting the effectiveness and resilience of the company’s strategies to the potential business impacts of the different scenarios, report preparers should be clear about uncertainties but as precise as possible with how the impacts of risks differ by geography, operations and time horizon. Clear articulation of the specific sensitivities to the different scenarios will allow report users to better understand the potential responses identified by the company as a result of the exercise, whether that is no response, changes to financial planning and investment, or reimagining the business model. 3. Iteration and learning Climate-related risks and opportunities are highly dynamic and dependent upon changes in complex climate systems and political, economic and societal arenas as well as the exposure of the company or asset and its associated vulnerabilities.11 The qualities and dimensions of climate-related risks and opportunities for companies are likely to change over time, whether gradually or abruptly. Given this, using the findings of such exercises to assess corporate outlook are an important means of updating risk and opportunity identification systems and refine or reformulate climate-related policies, strategies and targets. This will better prepare the company in limiting and seizing climate-related risks and opportunities. Including such learnings and how they have been incorporated into systems and ambitions in the mainstream report is a valuable means of demonstrating effective and efficient management of material climate-related matters to investors. 11 David Viner et al (2020) Understanding the dynamic nature of risk in climate change assessments — A new starting point for discussion.

Important considerations While the Climate Guidance has focused on the first six reporting requirements of the CDSB Framework, companies should not mistake the importance of the remaining six reporting requirements, which are essential to completeness. In addition, when developing material climate disclosures, companies should ensure that the seven guiding principles of the CDSB Framework are followed to ensure high-quality, decision-useful reporting. Below, we draw attention to three, more particular considerations to assist report preparers in developing mainstream climate disclosures in line with the CDSB Framework. 1. Relevance and materiality When seeking to use the climate-related guidance offered for REQ-01 to REQ-06 of the CDSB Framework, companies must ensure that the principles of relevance and materiality have been applied. The Climate Guidance is designed for companies who have identified climate- related risks and opportunities as material, but not all of the suggested reporting practices offered will necessarily be applicable for inclusion in the mainstream report of all companies that have deemed climate material. The reporting practices of the Climate Guidance should be applied and disclosed against, like all information for the mainstream report, when the information is deemed material by the company. Principle 1 of the CDSB Framework offers that information is material if: • The impacts or results it describes are, due to their size and nature, expected to have a significant positive or negative impact on the company’s financial condition and operational results and its ability to execute its strategy; or • Omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence the decisions that users of mainstream reports make on the basis of that mainstream report, which provides information about a specific reporting company.REQ-11 of the CDSB Framework encourages companies include a statement of conformance, setting out the extent that the principles and reporting requirements of the CDSB Framework have been applied. In doing so, companies are expected to state the outcome of applying the relevance and materiality principle. 2. Reporting boundaries and periods REQ-07 of the CDSB Framework concerns the reporting boundaries employed by the company for the mainstream report. The CDSB Framework holds that the material climate- related information disclosed should be prepared according to the reporting boundaries used for the rest of the mainstream report. It may, however, be that climate-related information that falls outside this reporting boundary will be appropriate for inclusion in the mainstream report, such as relating to outsourced activities or where contracts expose a company to climate-related risks or opportunities. A common example of this is Scope 3 GHG emissions. REQ-07 of the CDSB Framework offers that information and data from outside the reporting boundary should be distinguished and the company’s approach to boundary setting be reported. More information on boundary setting and reporting can be found in CDSB’s Proposals for boundary setting in the mainstream report (see Appendix 3). In addition to the reporting boundary, REQ-09 of the CDSB Framework suggests that the material climate-related information and data included in the mainstream report should follow the reporting period of the rest of the report. Aligning the reporting period of the climate- related information included in the mainstream report better ensures that it can be connected with the other information disclosed, such as financial performance and other environmental data, and so enhance comparability, as advocated by Principles 3 and 4, respectively, of the CDSB Framework. 3. Using existing disclosures and resources The CDSB Framework and its reporting requirements intend to align with and',\n",
