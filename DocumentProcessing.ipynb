All rights reserved.', '2A significant proportion of the world’s businesses are small and medium-\\nsized enterprises (SMEs). Globally, micro-enterprises (SMEs with fewer \\nthan ten employees) alone account for 70% to 90% of all firms1. As such, \\nSMEs play an important role in reducing global emissions and bringing \\ninnovative climate solutions to the market. It is crucial that they are \\nequipped with the tools and resources needed to measure their emissions, \\nset greenhouse gas reduction targets grounded in science, take bold \\nactions, report on their progress and ultimately reduce their emissions. \\nThis framework provides guidelines for SMEs on doing exactly that. It is \\nopen for anyone to use and can be used directly by SMEs to guide their \\nreporting of climate impacts and strategies to multiple stakeholders. It can \\nalso be used by SME support organizations (such as consultancies) and \\ndata collectors to guide SMEs in climate disclosure.\\nThe IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report is the latest reminder that dangerous climate thresholds are rapidly nearing and that impacts \\nwill continue to occur sooner rather than later. With 1.1°C of warming so far2, our climate has already changed, and some impacts \\nare a reality.  Immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions of greenhouse gas emissions are needed to limit global temperature rise \\nto 1.5°C.\\nThe framework is built up of a core section (consisting of three modules referred to as the “core modules”) and four additional \\nmodules. Each module provides indicators that are considered important for SMEs to report on in their climate disclosures.OVERVIEW  \\nMODULE:\\nENERGY\\nREPORTINGMODULE:\\nVALUE CHAIN  \\nEMISSIONSMODULE:\\nMANAGEMENT & \\nRESILIENCEMODULE:\\nCLIMATE  \\nSOLUTIONS\\nModule Name Reasoning\\nCore Module: Measure Measuring emissions is a crucial first step that every company \\nmust take to understand its negative impact on the climate and \\ntake the right steps to reduce it.\\nCore Module: CommitSetting science-based targets that align with a 1.5°C future \\ndemonstrates a company’s commitment to reduce its \\ncontribution to climate change and provides structure to its \\nclimate action.MEASURE COMMITACTION  \\n& IMPACTCORE MODULES   \\n1Small, Medium, Strong.

', '3We recommend that SMEs adopt the core modules immediately and suggest that they report on the additional modules within \\nthree years. The modular approach is intended to make climate disclosure more manageable for SMEs, allowing them to prioritize \\nthe modules that are most important/relevant for them and their stakeholders. Having worked with SMEs over the last 12 years, \\nCDP has observed that companies can take about three years to build the capacity to provide high-quality data from when they \\nfirst get started. Although we recommend that SMEs report on all the modules in this framework within three years, we strongly \\nencourage them to do it as quickly as possible within that timeframe.Core Module: Action & ImpactReporting on key actions and initiatives a company is taking \\nto reduce its emissions is important for understanding what \\nthe company is doing to meet its targets and the impact of its \\ninitiatives on the company’s emissions.\\nEnergy reportingEnergy-related activities represent, for many sectors, the most \\nsignificant GHG emission sources. It is therefore important that \\ncompanies disclose information about their energy generation \\nand/or consumption. Energy disclosures incentivize companies \\nto pull the right levers for reducing their emissions and impact on \\nclimate change. \\nValue chain emissions A significant proportion of most companies’ emissions lie \\noutside their direct operations and are related to their supply \\nchain and end-users. Companies should measure and report \\nthese emissions and work with their suppliers, customers, and \\nother partners to truly reduce their impact on climate change.\\nManagement and resilienceFor a company to successfully and strategically change in \\nline with the transition to a low carbon economy, it requires \\ncommitment and drive from its leadership. In addition to that, \\nSMEs are often especially vulnerable to risks, including climate-\\nrelated risks, as they often do not have robust risk assessment \\nand management systems in place. Thus, demonstrating \\nclimate leadership and carrying out climate-risk assessments is \\nkey to ensuring competitiveness and climate resilience. \\nClimate solutionsSMEs are a force for innovation globally and have an \\nopportunity for significant contribution in the growing market \\nof low carbon products and services that enable third parties \\nto reduce their emissions throughout their value chains. \\nDisclosure on these products/services and their impacts would \\nenable SMEs to attract investment, allow their business to \\ngrow, and increase their contribution to limiting climate change. ', '4INTRODUCTION\\nThe world is at a critical junction for global climate action. Amid growing \\nattention and ambition, global greenhouse gas emissions still hit an all-\\ntime high in 2019. These need to halve by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050 \\nto decrease the risk of irreversible climate tipping points.\\nBusinesses are demonstrating transformational ambition \\non climate action; corporate leaders have been working to \\nreduce emissions within their operations and improve energy \\nefficiency for years. Corporate commitments are growing, as \\nevident in the exponential growth of companies joining the \\nUN Race to Zero Campaign (more than 3,000 companies) and \\nthe Science-based Targets Initiative (SBTi), with over 1,000 \\ncompanies having set targets aligned to a well-below 2°C or \\n1.5°C trajectory. Yet, much of this ambition and progress has \\nbeen driven by high emitting, large, global corporations due \\nto the public and investor pressure they face to reduce their \\nemissions. As a result, much of the support and guidelines \\navailable for sustainability reporting do not cater to the needs \\nof SMEs. \\nHowever, the transition is already underway, and if SMEs \\nare not brought on board, they risk facing competitive \\ndisadvantages and losing out on low carbon opportunities. \\nIt is vital that SMEs are supported in making the most of \\nthe opportunities presented by transitioning to a low carbon \\neconomy. Their flexibility and capability to innovate makes \\nthem well placed and crucial for providing climate solutions \\nthat are key for limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5°C. \\nSMEs are increasingly being requested to commit to reduce \\ntheir emissions and report progress against their commitments \\nby their stakeholders and lenders. For example, as supply \\nchain emissions are on average 11.4 times higher than \\noperational emissions3, many large companies want their \\nsuppliers, often SMEs, to measure, report and cut down \\ntheir own emissions - cascading climate action down the \\nsupply chain. SMEs that are unable to demonstrate their \\nenvironmental action risk losing out on important opportunities. \\nThis has wider economic and societal impacts as SMEs are \\na backbone of most economies and significantly contribute \\nto employment and social wellbeing. Being major engines of \\nvalue creation, SMEs account for between 50% and 70% of \\nvalue added in OECD economies. In emerging economies, \\nSMEs contribute to, on average, 33% of GDP4. SMEs have a very significant role to play in both employment \\nlevel and employment growth5. In high-income countries, \\nSMEs with up to 250 employees have a 65% contribution \\nto employment; the number rises to 78% for low-income \\ncountries6.  When it comes to employment growth, in a \\nmajority of countries, SMEs between 5-99 employees alone \\naccount for more than 50% of total net employment creation7.  \\nFurthermore, as financial institutions seek to reduce their \\nportfolio emissions, they require environmental data from \\ncompanies to feed into their investment and lending decisions. \\nMany SMEs rely on financing from banks. According to trade \\ncredit insurer Euler Hermes, bank loans make up around 70% \\nof external funding for European SMEs. \\nTherefore, it is important to provide SMEs with the framework, \\ntools and resources needed to set commitments aligned with a \\n1.5°C future and disclose environmental performance. \\nTo address this need, the SME Climate Hub was launched \\nin 2020 in order to support SMEs on a large scale, providing \\nthem with resources to commit to reduce their emissions and \\nreport progress. This Framework will be available on the Hub \\nfor all SMEs to access. \\nDefining SMEs \\nFor the purpose of this framework, SMEs are defined as non-subsidiary organizations with fewer than 500 employees, which \\nis in line with the definition used by the SME Climate Hub and the Science-based Targets Initiative. These can be further \\ncategorized as micro (fewer than 10), small (10-50) and medium (50-500). \\nThe definition of SMEs varies by country/region, however, employee numbers and revenue are the two most used indicators \\nto define SMEs. The varying definitions of SMEs represent the different policy and structural contexts in which they operate \\nas well as their vast heterogeneity8. At a firm and sector level, SMEs have meaningful variations based on other factors \\nsuch as business model and technical and managerial capacities. While these variations demonstrate that size, defined by \\nemployee number, is not the only way to group SMEs, it is still relevant because organizations of similar sizes share significant \\ncommonalities regarding resources and expertise available for environmental action and disclosure. \\n3Transparency to Transformation: A Chain Reaction, CDP Global Supply Chain Report, 2020.\\n4Small, Medium, Strong.

Therefore, they may choose \\nto focus on the core modules (Measure, Commit, Action & Impact). We have decided not to have a separate set of indicators \\nfor these smaller SMEs because as the organization grows, along with its knowledge and reporting capability, it should start \\nreporting on all the modules in this framework. Having the same set of indicators for all SMEs will ensure that the data reported \\nis consistent and comparable, facilitating its use in benchmarking and decision making by investors, purchasers, policymakers \\nand other stakeholders. \\nPurpose\\nThis framework is intended to stimulate SMEs’ understanding and reporting of the most vital climate-related indicators and \\nencourage immediate climate action.\\nIt is recommended that SMEs use this framework to aid their sustainability reporting processes so that data on the SME’s \\nclimate performance can be provided to investors, purchasers, policymakers and other stakeholders in a consistent and \\ncomparable manner. These stakeholders will then be able to reduce their climate risks at a portfolio level and make decisions \\naligned with a net-zero future, while SMEs will be able to meet future requests from these stakeholders and increase their \\ncompetitiveness.\\nUltimately, use of this framework will empower SMEs to measure, manage and track their progress against their climate \\ncommitments and provide a clear pathway to climate leadership. Users of the framework will be enabled to play an active role \\nin the transition to a low carbon world and build resilience to climate change.\\nObjectives\\nIn order to achieve the purpose of stimulating SMEs’ understanding and reporting of the most \\nvital climate-related indicators and encouraging immediate climate action, this framework \\naims to be:\\n  Modular, to enable flexibility to expand into other areas of environmental disclosure;\\n  Understandable, through use of straightforward language\\n  Open access and available for all;\\n  Streamlined and resource efficient to represent the minimum reporting requirements;  \\n  Representative of best practice through alignment with other reporting frameworks.\\nDevelopment\\nBased on experience from CDP’s questionnaire and desktop research, this streamlined reporting framework is co-designed \\nwith the SME Climate Hub represented by the Exponential Roadmap Initiative (XRI), Normative and the We Mean Business \\nCoalition. The development process includes researching the best practice available from other initiatives, standards, and \\nframeworks such as the GHG Protocol, SBTi, TCFD, the 1.5 Business Playbook and the UN Race to Zero criteria. Based on the \\nresearch results, alignment was implemented where deemed appropriate, bearing in mind the specific needs of SMEs and the \\nobjectives of this framework.\\nA public consultation was held, inviting feedback from SMEs, framework stakeholders and other intended users of this \\nframework which informed the refining of the framework. \\nThroughout 2021 and 2022, CDP , in collaboration with the SME Climate Hub, will invite and consolidate feedback from SMEs \\nand other intended users who trial the framework, informing the review and further developments in the framework in an \\niterative process. The framework will be updated on a regular basis in a version-controlled manner. ', '6Intended users\\nThe users of this framework can be divided into three groups: data providers, data users and organizations that link the two. \\nHere, data providers are SMEs that will use the framework to disclose data on their climate impact and action. Data users \\nare defined as organizations that use the disclosed information in decision-making processes involving the data providers. \\nThe two main types of organizations we envisage linking the data providers and users are SME support organizations and \\ndata collectors. Both may connect data providers with the framework, assist with reporting on the indicators defined in the \\nframework, and supply the resulting information to the data users*. Please see examples of these groups in the infographic \\nbelow.\\nDATA PROVIDERS DATA USERS\\n• SMEs \\nFor the definition of SMEs  \\nplease see the section  \\n‘Defining SMEs’ above \\n \\nNote: This also includes SMEs  \\nthat specialize in providing \\nproducts and services that  \\naid companies in reducing  \\ntheir emissions in their  \\nvalue chains.• Procurers or purchasing \\norganizations \\nOrganizations which will use \\ndisclosed data to aid purchasing \\ndecision making\\n• Financial institutions  \\n(investors and lenders) \\nOrganizations which will use \\ndisclosed data to aid investment \\ndecision making. \\n• Other data users such as \\nresearchers and policymakers\\n*We envisage data collectors and SME support organizations linking data providers and data users, but going through these \\nlinking organizations is not necessary.

', '8This section consists of the key areas of disclosure for SMEs. It is recommended that: \\n  SMEs report against metrics and indicators in the core component. \\n  Data users/stakeholders communicate to SMEs which modules they would like to see prioritized depending on the needs  \\n  of the data user and factors unique to the SME, such as business type.\\n  SMEs look to expand their reporting to cover the four additional modules within three yearsMODULES:  \\nREPORTING REQUIREMENTS  \\nAND RECOMMENDATIONS  \\nCORE MODULES  \\nEach module recommends (“should”) or requires (“shall”) certain indicators \\nand metrics from SMEs that are considered to be important, factoring in the \\nrequirements of data users and needs of the SMEs.\\n• Throughout the modules the term \"shall\" is used to indicate a requirement. \\nIndicators denoted using \"shall\" are considered to be crucial reporting for \\nSMEs regardless of the disclosers’ reporting experience.\\n• Throughout the modules the term \"should\" is used to indicate a \\nrecommendation. Indicators denoted using \"should\" are considered to be \\noptional, especially for small SMEs or those in their first year of reporting; \\nhowever, reporting on these indicators is strongly advocated within three years. How to use the Framework \\nThis framework lays out the key climate-related indicators that SMEs should report on, and SMEs should use it to inform their \\ndisclosures. Companies may report this information in their mainstream reports or when using other data collection or reporting \\nplatforms.\\nThis framework does not contain detailed guidance on how to report on the indicators, as there is a lot of guidance available \\nthat is suitable for SMEs to use. The SME Climate Hub has a dedicated “tools and resources” section that we encourage SMEs \\nto utilize when reporting on the indicators in this framework. \\nWe highly recommend reading each module’s “Guidance and definitions” section to understand the indicators laid out \\nin the framework better.MODULE:\\nENERGY\\nREPORTINGMODULE:\\nVALUE CHAIN  \\nEMISSIONSMODULE:\\nMANAGEMENT & \\nRESILIENCEMODULE:\\nCLIMATE  \\nSOLUTIONSMEASURE COMMITACTION  \\n& IMPACT', '9Every company should measure \\nits emissions and determine its \\nimpact on the climate as a starting \\npoint.

You may also find some tools suitable specifically for SMEs in the “Tools and \\nResources” section of the SME Climate Hub.\\nAs specified in the table above, there are two methods of calculating Scope 2 emissions – \\nlocation and market based. \\n• The location-based method considers the average emission factors for the electricity \\ngrids that provide electricity to the reporting organization.\\n• The market-based method reflects emissions from the electricity that the reporting \\norganizations have chosen or purchased in the market. It considers contractual \\narrangements under which the reporting organization procures power from specific \\nsuppliers or sources, such  \\nas renewable energy. \\nAs summarized by the World Resource Institute, reporting both figures tells an important \\nstory about the company’s carbon footprint and carbon reduction strategy. The location-\\nbased method reveals what the company is physically putting into the air, and the market-\\nbased method shows emissions that the company is responsible for through its purchasing \\ndecisions. For more information on this please refer to the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance.\\nReporting year: The most recent 12-month period for which data is provided.\\nGross global emissions: This means total emissions before any deductions or other \\nadjustments are made to take account of things such as offset credits or avoided emissions \\nfrom the use of goods and services.\\nEmissions intensity: Emissions (metric tons CO2e) / Business metric (e.g., revenue). \\nIntensity metrics describe an organization’s CO2e emissions in the context of another \\nbusiness metric. In this way, the emissions are normalized to account for growth. Emissions \\nintensity per unit of revenue is one the most common and easy means to calculate emissions \\nintensity, which is why it is preferred that you provide this figure. However, this is not \\nnecessarily always the most appropriate to individual businesses and therefore you can  \\nalso report an intensity or normalized metric that is most appropriate to your organization’s \\nown operations.', '11It is essential for every company \\nto commit to reduce their \\nenvironmental impact.

In addition, the priority of the four \\nadditional modules (energy reporting, value chain emissions, management and resilience, and climate solutions) varies \\ndepending on the SME and the needs of the stakeholder or authority that is requesting the SME to disclose. \\nThe modular design of this framework and the recommended three-year time frame for building capacity should \\nprovide flexibility for different SMEs and data requesters to tailor the use of this framework to their disclosure needs \\nand reporting capability.

       " 'A significant proportion of the world’s businesses are small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs). Globally, micro-enterprises (SMEs with fewer than ten employees) alone account for 70% to 90% of all firms1. As such, SMEs play an important role in reducing global emissions and bringing innovative climate solutions to the market. It is crucial that they are equipped with the tools and resources needed to measure their emissions, set greenhouse gas reduction targets grounded in science, take bold actions, report on their progress and ultimately reduce their emissions. This framework provides guidelines for SMEs on doing exactly that. It is open for anyone to use and can be used directly by SMEs to guide their reporting of climate impacts and strategies to multiple stakeholders. It can also be used by SME support organizations (such as consultancies) and data collectors to guide SMEs in climate disclosure. The IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report is the latest reminder that dangerous climate thresholds are rapidly nearing and that impacts will continue to occur sooner rather than later. With 1.1°C of warming so far2, our climate has already changed, and some impacts are a reality. Immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions of greenhouse gas emissions are needed to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C. The framework is built up of a core section (consisting of three modules referred to as the “core modules”) and four additional modules. Each module provides indicators that are considered important for SMEs to report on in their climate disclosures.OVERVIEW MODULE: ENERGY REPORTINGMODULE: VALUE CHAIN EMISSIONSMODULE: MANAGEMENT & RESILIENCEMODULE: CLIMATE SOLUTIONS Module Name Reasoning Core Module: Measure Measuring emissions is a crucial first step that every company must take to understand its negative impact on the climate and take the right steps to reduce it. Core Module: CommitSetting science-based targets that align with a 1.5°C future demonstrates a company’s commitment to reduce its contribution to climate change and provides structure to its climate action.MEASURE COMMITACTION & IMPACTCORE MODULES 1Small, Medium, Strong.

       " 'We recommend that SMEs adopt the core modules immediately and suggest that they report on the additional modules within three years. The modular approach is intended to make climate disclosure more manageable for SMEs, allowing them to prioritize the modules that are most important/relevant for them and their stakeholders. Having worked with SMEs over the last 12 years, CDP has observed that companies can take about three years to build the capacity to provide high-quality data from when they first get started. Although we recommend that SMEs report on all the modules in this framework within three years, we strongly encourage them to do it as quickly as possible within that timeframe.Core Module: Action & ImpactReporting on key actions and initiatives a company is taking to reduce its emissions is important for understanding what the company is doing to meet its targets and the impact of its initiatives on the company’s emissions. Energy reportingEnergy-related activities represent, for many sectors, the most significant GHG emission sources. It is therefore important that companies disclose information about their energy generation and/or consumption. Energy disclosures incentivize companies to pull the right levers for reducing their emissions and impact on climate change. Value chain emissions A significant proportion of most companies’ emissions lie outside their direct operations and are related to their supply chain and end-users. Companies should measure and report these emissions and work with their suppliers, customers, and other partners to truly reduce their impact on climate change. Management and resilienceFor a company to successfully and strategically change in line with the transition to a low carbon economy, it requires commitment and drive from its leadership. In addition to that, SMEs are often especially vulnerable to risks, including climate- related risks, as they often do not have robust risk assessment and management systems in place. Thus, demonstrating climate leadership and carrying out climate-risk assessments is key to ensuring competitiveness and climate resilience. Climate solutionsSMEs are a force for innovation globally and have an opportunity for significant contribution in the growing market of low carbon products and services that enable third parties to reduce their emissions throughout their value chains. Disclosure on these products/services and their impacts would enable SMEs to attract investment, allow their business to grow, and increase their contribution to limiting climate change.',\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION The world is at a critical junction for global climate action. Amid growing attention and ambition, global greenhouse gas emissions still hit an all- time high in 2019. These need to halve by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050 to decrease the risk of irreversible climate tipping points. Businesses are demonstrating transformational ambition on climate action; corporate leaders have been working to reduce emissions within their operations and improve energy efficiency for years. Corporate commitments are growing, as evident in the exponential growth of companies joining the UN Race to Zero Campaign (more than 3,000 companies) and the Science-based Targets Initiative (SBTi), with over 1,000 companies having set targets aligned to a well-below 2°C or 1.5°C trajectory. Yet, much of this ambition and progress has been driven by high emitting, large, global corporations due to the public and investor pressure they face to reduce their emissions. As a result, much of the support and guidelines available for sustainability reporting do not cater to the needs of SMEs. However, the transition is already underway, and if SMEs are not brought on board, they risk facing competitive disadvantages and losing out on low carbon opportunities. It is vital that SMEs are supported in making the most of the opportunities presented by transitioning to a low carbon economy. Their flexibility and capability to innovate makes them well placed and crucial for providing climate solutions that are key for limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5°C. SMEs are increasingly being requested to commit to reduce their emissions and report progress against their commitments by their stakeholders and lenders. For example, as supply chain emissions are on average 11.4 times higher than operational emissions3, many large companies want their suppliers, often SMEs, to measure, report and cut down their own emissions - cascading climate action down the supply chain. SMEs that are unable to demonstrate their environmental action risk losing out on important opportunities. This has wider economic and societal impacts as SMEs are a backbone of most economies and significantly contribute to employment and social wellbeing. Being major engines of value creation, SMEs account for between 50% and 70% of value added in OECD economies. In emerging economies, SMEs contribute to, on average, 33% of GDP4. SMEs have a very significant role to play in both employment level and employment growth5. In high-income countries, SMEs with up to 250 employees have a 65% contribution to employment; the number rises to 78% for low-income countries6. When it comes to employment growth, in a majority of countries, SMEs between 5-99 employees alone account for more than 50% of total net employment creation7. Furthermore, as financial institutions seek to reduce their portfolio emissions, they require environmental data from companies to feed into their investment and lending decisions. Many SMEs rely on financing from banks. According to trade credit insurer Euler Hermes, bank loans make up around 70% of external funding for European SMEs. Therefore, it is important to provide SMEs with the framework, tools and resources needed to set commitments aligned with a 1.5°C future and disclose environmental performance. To address this need, the SME Climate Hub was launched in 2020 in order to support SMEs on a large scale, providing them with resources to commit to reduce their emissions and report progress. This Framework will be available on the Hub for all SMEs to access. Defining SMEs For the purpose of this framework, SMEs are defined as non-subsidiary organizations with fewer than 500 employees, which is in line with the definition used by the SME Climate Hub and the Science-based Targets Initiative. These can be further categorized as micro (fewer than 10), small (10-50) and medium (50-500). The definition of SMEs varies by country/region, however, employee numbers and revenue are the two most used indicators to define SMEs. The varying definitions of SMEs represent the different policy and structural contexts in which they operate as well as their vast heterogeneity8. At a firm and sector level, SMEs have meaningful variations based on other factors such as business model and technical and managerial capacities. While these variations demonstrate that size, defined by employee number, is not the only way to group SMEs, it is still relevant because organizations of similar sizes share significant commonalities regarding resources and expertise available for environmental action and disclosure. 3Transparency to Transformation: A Chain Reaction, CDP Global Supply Chain Report, 2020. 4Small, Medium, Strong.

       " 'Note on micro and small SMEs We acknowledge that reporting on all the modules in this framework may be too difficult for micro (fewer than 10 employees) and small (10-50 employees) SMEs, and that some of the indicators might not be relevant to them. Therefore, they may choose to focus on the core modules (Measure, Commit, Action & Impact). We have decided not to have a separate set of indicators for these smaller SMEs because as the organization grows, along with its knowledge and reporting capability, it should start reporting on all the modules in this framework. Having the same set of indicators for all SMEs will ensure that the data reported is consistent and comparable, facilitating its use in benchmarking and decision making by investors, purchasers, policymakers and other stakeholders. Purpose This framework is intended to stimulate SMEs’ understanding and reporting of the most vital climate-related indicators and encourage immediate climate action. It is recommended that SMEs use this framework to aid their sustainability reporting processes so that data on the SME’s climate performance can be provided to investors, purchasers, policymakers and other stakeholders in a consistent and comparable manner. These stakeholders will then be able to reduce their climate risks at a portfolio level and make decisions aligned with a net-zero future, while SMEs will be able to meet future requests from these stakeholders and increase their competitiveness. Ultimately, use of this framework will empower SMEs to measure, manage and track their progress against their climate commitments and provide a clear pathway to climate leadership. Users of the framework will be enabled to play an active role in the transition to a low carbon world and build resilience to climate change. Objectives In order to achieve the purpose of stimulating SMEs’ understanding and reporting of the most vital climate-related indicators and encouraging immediate climate action, this framework aims to be: Modular, to enable flexibility to expand into other areas of environmental disclosure; Understandable, through use of straightforward language Open access and available for all; Streamlined and resource efficient to represent the minimum reporting requirements; Representative of best practice through alignment with other reporting frameworks. Development Based on experience from CDP’s questionnaire and desktop research, this streamlined reporting framework is co-designed with the SME Climate Hub represented by the Exponential Roadmap Initiative (XRI), Normative and the We Mean Business Coalition. The development process includes researching the best practice available from other initiatives, standards, and frameworks such as the GHG Protocol, SBTi, TCFD, the 1.5 Business Playbook and the UN Race to Zero criteria. Based on the research results, alignment was implemented where deemed appropriate, bearing in mind the specific needs of SMEs and the objectives of this framework. A public consultation was held, inviting feedback from SMEs, framework stakeholders and other intended users of this framework which informed the refining of the framework. Throughout 2021 and 2022, CDP , in collaboration with the SME Climate Hub, will invite and consolidate feedback from SMEs and other intended users who trial the framework, informing the review and further developments in the framework in an iterative process. The framework will be updated on a regular basis in a version-controlled manner.',\n",
       " 'Intended users The users of this framework can be divided into three groups: data providers, data users and organizations that link the two. Here, data providers are SMEs that will use the framework to disclose data on their climate impact and action. Data users are defined as organizations that use the disclosed information in decision-making processes involving the data providers. The two main types of organizations we envisage linking the data providers and users are SME support organizations and data collectors. Both may connect data providers with the framework, assist with reporting on the indicators defined in the framework, and supply the resulting information to the data users*. Please see examples of these groups in the infographic below. DATA PROVIDERS DATA USERS • SMEs For the definition of SMEs please see the section ‘Defining SMEs’ above Note: This also includes SMEs that specialize in providing products and services that aid companies in reducing their emissions in their value chains.• Procurers or purchasing organizations Organizations which will use disclosed data to aid purchasing decision making • Financial institutions (investors and lenders) Organizations which will use disclosed data to aid investment decision making. • Other data users such as researchers and policymakers *We envisage data collectors and SME support organizations linking data providers and data users, but going through these linking organizations is not necessary. Data providers are welcome to use this framework to provide data in a consistent manner directly to data users. DATA COLLECTORS* e.g CDP and the SME Climate HubSME SUPPORT* e.g Environmental consultancies ALIGNMENT AND MAPPING WITH OTHER FRAMEWORKS Approach to alignment Alignment with and influence from frameworks and standards such as the GHG Protocol, TCFD, CDSB, SBTi, SDGs and the 1.5 Business Playbook. Full alignment might not be appropriate as most reporting frameworks and standards are geared towards larger organizations. However, they can still inform SME reporting and as such, relevant elements have been identified and adapted for use in this framework. Standalone mapping documents may be produced at a later stage, showing overlap and alignment with other existing frameworks.',\n",
       " 'GUIDING PRINCIPLES Purpose of principles The seven principles below underpin this framework’s disclosure recommendations/requirements and are designed to ensure that the data generated is of high quality and decision-useful for SME stakeholders, including financial institutions. Additionally, disclosures aligned with these principles will incentivize climate action among SMEs and improve understanding of their environmental impact. These draw from the principles of the following key frameworks and standards: TCFD, CDSB and the GHG Protocol. 01 Disclosures shall be relevant to SMEs and their data users. 02 Disclosures shall be clear and understandable 03 Disclosures shall be objective and accurate. 04 Disclosures shall be complete and verifiable. 05 Disclosures shall be comparable to best practice corporate disclosures. 06 Disclosures shall drive impactful SME climate action. 07 Disclosures shall be annual and provided in a consistent format.',\n",
       " 'This section consists of the key areas of disclosure for SMEs. It is recommended that: SMEs report against metrics and indicators in the core component. Data users/stakeholders communicate to SMEs which modules they would like to see prioritized depending on the needs of the data user and factors unique to the SME, such as business type. SMEs look to expand their reporting to cover the four additional modules within three yearsMODULES: REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS CORE MODULES Each module recommends (“should”) or requires (“shall”) certain indicators and metrics from SMEs that are considered to be important, factoring in the requirements of data users and needs of the SMEs. • Throughout the modules the term \"shall\" is used to indicate a requirement. Indicators denoted using \"shall\" are considered to be crucial reporting for SMEs regardless of the disclosers’ reporting experience. • Throughout the modules the term \"should\" is used to indicate a recommendation. Indicators denoted using \"should\" are considered to be optional, especially for small SMEs or those in their first year of reporting; however, reporting on these indicators is strongly advocated within three years. How to use the Framework This framework lays out the key climate-related indicators that SMEs should report on, and SMEs should use it to inform their disclosures. Companies may report this information in their mainstream reports or when using other data collection or reporting platforms. This framework does not contain detailed guidance on how to report on the indicators, as there is a lot of guidance available that is suitable for SMEs to use. The SME Climate Hub has a dedicated “tools and resources” section that we encourage SMEs to utilize when reporting on the indicators in this framework. We highly recommend reading each module’s “Guidance and definitions” section to understand the indicators laid out in the framework better.MODULE: ENERGY REPORTINGMODULE: VALUE CHAIN EMISSIONSMODULE: MANAGEMENT & RESILIENCEMODULE: CLIMATE SOLUTIONSMEASURE COMMITACTION & IMPACT',\n",

Only then can the company begin to manage and reduce its negative environmental impact effectively. This module lays out the minimum level of disclosure required from SMEs regarding their emissions, aligned with existing standards and best practices such as the GHG Protocol, recognizing that emissions calculation can be challenging. There are several tools and resources available that can help SMEs get started with measuring their emissions; some of them are listed in the guidance section below.MEASURE Connections to other frameworks TCFD Metrics and targets recommended disclosure b) Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and, if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the related risks SDG Goal 13: Climate action Measure What are your gross global operational emissions (Scope 1 and 2)?Companies shall provide: • Reporting year • Gross global emissions from combustion in owned or controlled boilers, furnaces, vehicles, etc. (Scope 1) • Gross global emissions from electricity purchases (and purchased heat, steam and cooling) in the reporting year (Scope 2) * • Calculation methodology Companies should provide a breakdown of their reported Scope 1 and Scope 2 figures. Companies shall ensure that there are mechanisms in place to confirm that the emissions data provided is sufficiently accurate and provide a comment on the accuracy. *For companies operating in areas where market instruments are available, both location-based and market-based Scope 2 figures should be provided.

       " 'Guidance and definitions The GHG Protocol sets standards to measure and manage emissions. The website provides calculation tools as well as PDFs of the Corporate Standard and Scope 2 Guidance. Please refer to the website if you would like explanations or examples of the disclosure requirements above. You may also find some tools suitable specifically for SMEs in the “Tools and Resources” section of the SME Climate Hub. As specified in the table above, there are two methods of calculating Scope 2 emissions – location and market based. • The location-based method considers the average emission factors for the electricity grids that provide electricity to the reporting organization. • The market-based method reflects emissions from the electricity that the reporting organizations have chosen or purchased in the market. It considers contractual arrangements under which the reporting organization procures power from specific suppliers or sources, such as renewable energy. As summarized by the World Resource Institute, reporting both figures tells an important story about the company’s carbon footprint and carbon reduction strategy. The location- based method reveals what the company is physically putting into the air, and the market- based method shows emissions that the company is responsible for through its purchasing decisions. For more information on this please refer to the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance. Reporting year: The most recent 12-month period for which data is provided. Gross global emissions: This means total emissions before any deductions or other adjustments are made to take account of things such as offset credits or avoided emissions from the use of goods and services. Emissions intensity: Emissions (metric tons CO2e) / Business metric (e.g., revenue). Intensity metrics describe an organization’s CO2e emissions in the context of another business metric. In this way, the emissions are normalized to account for growth. Emissions intensity per unit of revenue is one the most common and easy means to calculate emissions intensity, which is why it is preferred that you provide this figure. However, this is not necessarily always the most appropriate to individual businesses and therefore you can also report an intensity or normalized metric that is most appropriate to your organization’s own operations.',\n",

SMEs setting targets aligned with science demonstrate initiative to their stakeholders and financial institutions. The details of targets help data users understand how robust they are and whether they are consistent with a 1.5°C future. Some initiatives allow SMEs to select from a set of pre-defined targets aligned with science, making the target-setting process simpler for SMEs.

Climate-related risks can be divided into two main categories: risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy (transition risks) and risks related to the physical impacts of climate change (physical risks). Risk types: Transition risks: Current and emerging regulation: policy developments that attempt to constrain actions that contribute to the adverse effects of climate change or policy developments that seek to promote adaptation to climate change; Technology: all risks associated with technological improvements or innovations that support the transition to a low-carbon, energy-efficient economic system; Legal: all climate-related litigation claims; Market: all shifts in supply and demand for certain commodities, products, and services; Reputation: all risks tied to changing customer or community perceptions of an organization’s contribution to or detraction from the transition to a low-carbon economy. Physical risks: Acute: risks that are event-driven, including increased severity of extreme weather events, such as cyclones, hurricanes, or floods; Chronic: longer-term shifts in climate patterns (e.g., sustained higher temperatures) that may cause sea level rise or chronic heat waves. Time horizons of climate-related risks: There is a common perception that all climate-related risks are “long-term”, arising in 10+ years; however, transitional risks such as policies, technology, and markets are emerging earlier than this, and physical risks including the frequency and intensity of storms, floods, and droughts are recognized risks today.

       " 'CONCLUSION AND AREAS FOR FUTURE WORK This framework lays out the indicators and metrics that SMEs should cover in their climate disclosure, attempting to strike a balance between comprehensive climate disclosure and reduced reporting burden. It is acknowledged that the heterogeneity of SMEs – due to factors such as company size, experience with climate disclosure and nature of products/services offered by the business – means that not all indicators are relevant for all SMEs (although it is expected that the core section will be relevant for most SMEs). In addition, the priority of the four additional modules (energy reporting, value chain emissions, management and resilience, and climate solutions) varies depending on the SME and the needs of the stakeholder or authority that is requesting the SME to disclose. The modular design of this framework and the recommended three-year time frame for building capacity should provide flexibility for different SMEs and data requesters to tailor the use of this framework to their disclosure needs and reporting capability. The framework is influenced by key frameworks and standards and will continue to evolve with developments in climate disclosure standards. Although this framework focuses on SME climate disclosure, there are other areas of SME disclosure that might be included in the future, such as: Carbon removals Measurable climate mitigation outcomes resulting from actions outside of a company’s value chain, such as investing in nature protection or reforestation (also referred to as ‘compensation’) Broader environmental topics (e.g., water security, deforestation, biodiversity)',\n",

       " 'A significant proportion of the world’s businesses are small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs). Globally, micro-enterprises (SMEs with fewer than ten employees) alone account for 70% to 90% of all firms1. As such, SMEs play an important role in reducing global emissions and bringing innovative climate solutions to the market. It is crucial that they are equipped with the tools and resources needed to measure their emissions, set greenhouse gas reduction targets grounded in science, take bold actions, report on their progress and ultimately reduce their emissions. This framework provides guidelines for SMEs on doing exactly that. It is open for anyone to use and can be used directly by SMEs to guide their reporting of climate impacts and strategies to multiple stakeholders. It can also be used by SME support organizations (such as consultancies) and data collectors to guide SMEs in climate disclosure. The IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report is the latest reminder that dangerous climate thresholds are rapidly nearing and that impacts will continue to occur sooner rather than later. With 1.1°C of warming so far2, our climate has already changed, and some impacts are a reality. Immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions of greenhouse gas emissions are needed to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C. The framework is built up of a core section (consisting of three modules referred to as the “core modules”) and four additional modules. Each module provides indicators that are considered important for SMEs to report on in their climate disclosures.OVERVIEW MODULE: ENERGY REPORTINGMODULE: VALUE CHAIN EMISSIONSMODULE: MANAGEMENT & RESILIENCEMODULE: CLIMATE SOLUTIONS Module Name Reasoning Core Module: Measure Measuring emissions is a crucial first step that every company must take to understand its negative impact on the climate and take the right steps to reduce it.

       " 'We recommend that SMEs adopt the core modules immediately and suggest that they report on the additional modules within three years. The modular approach is intended to make climate disclosure more manageable for SMEs, allowing them to prioritize the modules that are most important/relevant for them and their stakeholders. Having worked with SMEs over the last 12 years, CDP has observed that companies can take about three years to build the capacity to provide high-quality data from when they first get started. Although we recommend that SMEs report on all the modules in this framework within three years, we strongly encourage them to do it as quickly as possible within that timeframe.Core Module: Action & ImpactReporting on key actions and initiatives a company is taking to reduce its emissions is important for understanding what the company is doing to meet its targets and the impact of its initiatives on the company’s emissions. Energy reportingEnergy-related activities represent, for many sectors, the most significant GHG emission sources. It is therefore important that companies disclose information about their energy generation and/or consumption. Energy disclosures incentivize companies to pull the right levers for reducing their emissions and impact on climate change. Value chain emissions A significant proportion of most companies’ emissions lie outside their direct operations and are related to their supply chain and end-users. Companies should measure and report these emissions and work with their suppliers, customers, and other partners to truly reduce their impact on climate change. Management and resilienceFor a company to successfully and strategically change in line with the transition to a low carbon economy, it requires commitment and drive from its leadership. In addition to that, SMEs are often especially vulnerable to risks, including climate- related risks, as they often do not have robust risk assessment and management systems in place. Thus, demonstrating climate leadership and carrying out climate-risk assessments is key to ensuring competitiveness and climate resilience. Climate solutionsSMEs are a force for innovation globally and have an opportunity for significant contribution in the growing market of low carbon products and services that enable third parties to reduce their emissions throughout their value chains. Disclosure on these products/services and their impacts would enable SMEs to attract investment, allow their business to grow, and increase their contribution to limiting climate change.',\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION The world is at a critical junction for global climate action. Amid growing attention and ambition, global greenhouse gas emissions still hit an all- time high in 2019. These need to halve by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050 to decrease the risk of irreversible climate tipping points. Businesses are demonstrating transformational ambition on climate action; corporate leaders have been working to reduce emissions within their operations and improve energy efficiency for years. Corporate commitments are growing, as evident in the exponential growth of companies joining the UN Race to Zero Campaign (more than 3,000 companies) and the Science-based Targets Initiative (SBTi), with over 1,000 companies having set targets aligned to a well-below 2°C or 1.5°C trajectory. Yet, much of this ambition and progress has been driven by high emitting, large, global corporations due to the public and investor pressure they face to reduce their emissions. As a result, much of the support and guidelines available for sustainability reporting do not cater to the needs of SMEs. However, the transition is already underway, and if SMEs are not brought on board, they risk facing competitive disadvantages and losing out on low carbon opportunities. It is vital that SMEs are supported in making the most of the opportunities presented by transitioning to a low carbon economy. Their flexibility and capability to innovate makes them well placed and crucial for providing climate solutions that are key for limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5°C. SMEs are increasingly being requested to commit to reduce their emissions and report progress against their commitments by their stakeholders and lenders. For example, as supply chain emissions are on average 11.4 times higher than operational emissions3, many large companies want their suppliers, often SMEs, to measure, report and cut down their own emissions - cascading climate action down the supply chain. SMEs that are unable to demonstrate their environmental action risk losing out on important opportunities. This has wider economic and societal impacts as SMEs are a backbone of most economies and significantly contribute to employment and social wellbeing. Being major engines of value creation, SMEs account for between 50% and 70% of value added in OECD economies. In emerging economies, SMEs contribute to, on average, 33% of GDP4. SMEs have a very significant role to play in both employment level and employment growth5. In high-income countries, SMEs with up to 250 employees have a 65% contribution to employment; the number rises to 78% for low-income countries6. When it comes to employment growth, in a majority of countries, SMEs between 5-99 employees alone account for more than 50% of total net employment creation7. Furthermore, as financial institutions seek to reduce their portfolio emissions, they require environmental data from companies to feed into their investment and lending decisions. Many SMEs rely on financing from banks. According to trade credit insurer Euler Hermes, bank loans make up around 70% of external funding for European SMEs. Therefore, it is important to provide SMEs with the framework, tools and resources needed to set commitments aligned with a 1.5°C future and disclose environmental performance. To address this need, the SME Climate Hub was launched in 2020 in order to support SMEs on a large scale, providing them with resources to commit to reduce their emissions and report progress. This Framework will be available on the Hub for all SMEs to access. Defining SMEs For the purpose of this framework, SMEs are defined as non-subsidiary organizations with fewer than 500 employees, which is in line with the definition used by the SME Climate Hub and the Science-based Targets Initiative. These can be further categorized as micro (fewer than 10), small (10-50) and medium (50-500). The definition of SMEs varies by country/region, however, employee numbers and revenue are the two most used indicators to define SMEs. The varying definitions of SMEs represent the different policy and structural contexts in which they operate as well as their vast heterogeneity8. At a firm and sector level, SMEs have meaningful variations based on other factors such as business model and technical and managerial capacities. While these variations demonstrate that size, defined by employee number, is not the only way to group SMEs, it is still relevant because organizations of similar sizes share significant commonalities regarding resources and expertise available for environmental action and disclosure. 3Transparency to Transformation: A Chain Reaction, CDP Global Supply Chain Report, 2020. 4Small, Medium, Strong.

       " 'Note on micro and small SMEs We acknowledge that reporting on all the modules in this framework may be too difficult for micro (fewer than 10 employees) and small (10-50 employees) SMEs, and that some of the indicators might not be relevant to them. Therefore, they may choose to focus on the core modules (Measure, Commit, Action & Impact). We have decided not to have a separate set of indicators for these smaller SMEs because as the organization grows, along with its knowledge and reporting capability, it should start reporting on all the modules in this framework. Having the same set of indicators for all SMEs will ensure that the data reported is consistent and comparable, facilitating its use in benchmarking and decision making by investors, purchasers, policymakers and other stakeholders. Purpose This framework is intended to stimulate SMEs’ understanding and reporting of the most vital climate-related indicators and encourage immediate climate action. It is recommended that SMEs use this framework to aid their sustainability reporting processes so that data on the SME’s climate performance can be provided to investors, purchasers, policymakers and other stakeholders in a consistent and comparable manner. These stakeholders will then be able to reduce their climate risks at a portfolio level and make decisions aligned with a net-zero future, while SMEs will be able to meet future requests from these stakeholders and increase their competitiveness. Ultimately, use of this framework will empower SMEs to measure, manage and track their progress against their climate commitments and provide a clear pathway to climate leadership. Users of the framework will be enabled to play an active role in the transition to a low carbon world and build resilience to climate change. Objectives In order to achieve the purpose of stimulating SMEs’ understanding and reporting of the most vital climate-related indicators and encouraging immediate climate action, this framework aims to be: Modular, to enable flexibility to expand into other areas of environmental disclosure; Understandable, through use of straightforward language Open access and available for all; Streamlined and resource efficient to represent the minimum reporting requirements; Representative of best practice through alignment with other reporting frameworks. Development Based on experience from CDP’s questionnaire and desktop research, this streamlined reporting framework is co-designed with the SME Climate Hub represented by the Exponential Roadmap Initiative (XRI), Normative and the We Mean Business Coalition. The development process includes researching the best practice available from other initiatives, standards, and frameworks such as the GHG Protocol, SBTi, TCFD, the 1.5 Business Playbook and the UN Race to Zero criteria. Based on the research results, alignment was implemented where deemed appropriate, bearing in mind the specific needs of SMEs and the objectives of this framework. A public consultation was held, inviting feedback from SMEs, framework stakeholders and other intended users of this framework which informed the refining of the framework. Throughout 2021 and 2022, CDP , in collaboration with the SME Climate Hub, will invite and consolidate feedback from SMEs and other intended users who trial the framework, informing the review and further developments in the framework in an iterative process. The framework will be updated on a regular basis in a version-controlled manner.',\n",
       " 'Intended users The users of this framework can be divided into three groups: data providers, data users and organizations that link the two. Here, data providers are SMEs that will use the framework to disclose data on their climate impact and action. Data users are defined as organizations that use the disclosed information in decision-making processes involving the data providers. The two main types of organizations we envisage linking the data providers and users are SME support organizations and data collectors. Both may connect data providers with the framework, assist with reporting on the indicators defined in the framework, and supply the resulting information to the data users*. Please see examples of these groups in the infographic below. DATA PROVIDERS DATA USERS • SMEs For the definition of SMEs please see the section ‘Defining SMEs’ above Note: This also includes SMEs that specialize in providing products and services that aid companies in reducing their emissions in their value chains.• Procurers or purchasing organizations Organizations which will use disclosed data to aid purchasing decision making • Financial institutions (investors and lenders) Organizations which will use disclosed data to aid investment decision making. • Other data users such as researchers and policymakers *We envisage data collectors and SME support organizations linking data providers and data users, but going through these linking organizations is not necessary. Data providers are welcome to use this framework to provide data in a consistent manner directly to data users. DATA COLLECTORS* e.g CDP and the SME Climate HubSME SUPPORT* e.g Environmental consultancies ALIGNMENT AND MAPPING WITH OTHER FRAMEWORKS Approach to alignment Alignment with and influence from frameworks and standards such as the GHG Protocol, TCFD, CDSB, SBTi, SDGs and the 1.5 Business Playbook. Full alignment might not be appropriate as most reporting frameworks and standards are geared towards larger organizations. However, they can still inform SME reporting and as such, relevant elements have been identified and adapted for use in this framework. Standalone mapping documents may be produced at a later stage, showing overlap and alignment with other existing frameworks.',\n",
       " 'GUIDING PRINCIPLES Purpose of principles The seven principles below underpin this framework’s disclosure recommendations/requirements and are designed to ensure that the data generated is of high quality and decision-useful for SME stakeholders, including financial institutions. Additionally, disclosures aligned with these principles will incentivize climate action among SMEs and improve understanding of their environmental impact. These draw from the principles of the following key frameworks and standards: TCFD, CDSB and the GHG Protocol. 01 Disclosures shall be relevant to SMEs and their data users. 02 Disclosures shall be clear and understandable 03 Disclosures shall be objective and accurate. 04 Disclosures shall be complete and verifiable. 05 Disclosures shall be comparable to best practice corporate disclosures. 06 Disclosures shall drive impactful SME climate action. 07 Disclosures shall be annual and provided in a consistent format.',\n",
       " 'This section consists of the key areas of disclosure for SMEs. It is recommended that: SMEs report against metrics and indicators in the core component. Data users/stakeholders communicate to SMEs which modules they would like to see prioritized depending on the needs of the data user and factors unique to the SME, such as business type. SMEs look to expand their reporting to cover the four additional modules within three yearsMODULES: REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS CORE MODULES Each module recommends (“should”) or requires (“shall”) certain indicators and metrics from SMEs that are considered to be important, factoring in the requirements of data users and needs of the SMEs. • Throughout the modules the term \"shall\" is used to indicate a requirement. Indicators denoted using \"shall\" are considered to be crucial reporting for SMEs regardless of the disclosers’ reporting experience. • Throughout the modules the term \"should\" is used to indicate a recommendation. Indicators denoted using \"should\" are considered to be optional, especially for small SMEs or those in their first year of reporting; however, reporting on these indicators is strongly advocated within three years. How to use the Framework This framework lays out the key climate-related indicators that SMEs should report on, and SMEs should use it to inform their disclosures. Companies may report this information in their mainstream reports or when using other data collection or reporting platforms. This framework does not contain detailed guidance on how to report on the indicators, as there is a lot of guidance available that is suitable for SMEs to use. The SME Climate Hub has a dedicated “tools and resources” section that we encourage SMEs to utilize when reporting on the indicators in this framework. We highly recommend reading each module’s “Guidance and definitions” section to understand the indicators laid out in the framework better.MODULE: ENERGY REPORTINGMODULE: VALUE CHAIN EMISSIONSMODULE: MANAGEMENT & RESILIENCEMODULE: CLIMATE SOLUTIONSMEASURE COMMITACTION & IMPACT',\n",
       " 'Every company should measure its emissions and determine its impact on the climate as a starting point. Only then can the company begin to manage and reduce its negative environmental impact effectively. This module lays out the minimum level of disclosure required from SMEs regarding their emissions, aligned with existing standards and best practices such as the GHG Protocol, recognizing that emissions calculation can be challenging. There are several tools and resources available that can help SMEs get started with measuring their emissions; some of them are listed in the guidance section below.MEASURE Connections to other frameworks TCFD Metrics and targets recommended disclosure b) Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and, if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the related risks SDG Goal 13: Climate action Measure What are your gross global operational emissions (Scope 1 and 2)?Companies shall provide: • Reporting year • Gross global emissions from combustion in owned or controlled boilers, furnaces, vehicles, etc. (Scope 1) • Gross global emissions from electricity purchases (and purchased heat, steam and cooling) in the reporting year (Scope 2) * • Calculation methodology Companies should provide a breakdown of their reported Scope 1 and Scope 2 figures. Companies shall ensure that there are mechanisms in place to confirm that the emissions data provided is sufficiently accurate and provide a comment on the accuracy. *For companies operating in areas where market instruments are available, both location-based and market-based Scope 2 figures should be provided. (See guidance below for more information) Are there any emissions that are in the reporting boundary but are excluded from the inventory?Companies shall disclose any relevant sources of emissions excluded and provide the magnitude of significance. Describe your emissions in the context of an appropriate business metric (Emissions intensity)Companies should disclose their gross global combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions for the reporting year, in metric tons CO2e, per unit of physical activity or economic output (preferably per unit of total revenue).',\n",
       " 'Guidance and definitions The GHG Protocol sets standards to measure and manage emissions. The website provides calculation tools as well as PDFs of the Corporate Standard and Scope 2 Guidance. Please refer to the website if you would like explanations or examples of the disclosure requirements above. You may also find some tools suitable specifically for SMEs in the “Tools and Resources” section of the SME Climate Hub. As specified in the table above, there are two methods of calculating Scope 2 emissions – location and market based. • The location-based method considers the average emission factors for the electricity grids that provide electricity to the reporting organization. • The market-based method reflects emissions from the electricity that the reporting organizations have chosen or purchased in the market. It considers contractual arrangements under which the reporting organization procures power from specific suppliers or sources, such as renewable energy. As summarized by the World Resource Institute, reporting both figures tells an important story about the company’s carbon footprint and carbon reduction strategy. The location- based method reveals what the company is physically putting into the air, and the market- based method shows emissions that the company is responsible for through its purchasing decisions. For more information on this please refer to the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance. Reporting year: The most recent 12-month period for which data is provided. Gross global emissions: This means total emissions before any deductions or other adjustments are made to take account of things such as offset credits or avoided emissions from the use of goods and services. Emissions intensity: Emissions (metric tons CO2e) / Business metric (e.g., revenue). Intensity metrics describe an organization’s CO2e emissions in the context of another business metric. In this way, the emissions are normalized to account for growth. Emissions intensity per unit of revenue is one the most common and easy means to calculate emissions intensity, which is why it is preferred that you provide this figure. However, this is not necessarily always the most appropriate to individual businesses and therefore you can also report an intensity or normalized metric that is most appropriate to your organization’s own operations.',\n",
       " 'It is essential for every company to commit to reduce their environmental impact. Target setting provides direction and structure to environmental strategy. SMEs setting targets aligned with science demonstrate initiative to their stakeholders and financial institutions. The details of targets help data users understand how robust they are and whether they are consistent with a 1.5°C future. Some initiatives allow SMEs to select from a set of pre-defined targets aligned with science, making the target-setting process simpler for SMEs. Two key examples are the SBTi’s SME initiative and the SME Climate Hub’s Climate Commitment.

Net-zero target: in line with the SBTi Corporate Net-Zero Standard, corporate net-zero is defined as: 1. Reducing scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions to zero or to a residual level that is consistent with reaching net-zero emissions at the global or sector level in eligible 1.5°C-aligned pathways 2. Neutralizing any residual emissions at the net-zero target year and any GHG emissions released into the atmosphere thereafter. For further guidance on setting net-zero targets please refer to the SBTi Corporate Net-Zero Standard Neutralization of emissions: neutralization of a company’s residual GHG emissions (emissions that are unfeasible to reduce) with an equivalent amount of carbon removals. An effective neutralization strategy involves removing carbon from the atmosphere and storing it for a long-enough period to fully neutralize the impact of any GHG that continues to be released into the atmosphere (adapted from Foundations for Science-based Net-Zero Target Setting in the Corporate Sector)9.',\n",

For a company to successfully transition to low carbon, commitment and drive from its leadership is required. There is strong evidence that companies who integrate climate-related decisions and initiatives in the company-wide strategy are more likely to be able to take meaningful action and meet their climate- related targets. Banks and lenders are increasingly requesting information on a company’s climate risks.

Climate-related risks can be divided into two main categories: risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy (transition risks) and risks related to the physical impacts of climate change (physical risks).

Physical risks: Acute: risks that are event-driven, including increased severity of extreme weather events, such as cyclones, hurricanes, or floods; Chronic: longer-term shifts in climate patterns (e.g., sustained higher temperatures) that may cause sea level rise or chronic heat waves. Time horizons of climate-related risks: There is a common perception that all climate-related risks are “long-term”, arising in 10+ years; however, transitional risks such as policies, technology, and markets are emerging earlier than this, and physical risks including the frequency and intensity of storms, floods, and droughts are recognized risks today.

       " 'CONCLUSION AND AREAS FOR FUTURE WORK This framework lays out the indicators and metrics that SMEs should cover in their climate disclosure, attempting to strike a balance between comprehensive climate disclosure and reduced reporting burden. It is acknowledged that the heterogeneity of SMEs – due to factors such as company size, experience with climate disclosure and nature of products/services offered by the business – means that not all indicators are relevant for all SMEs (although it is expected that the core section will be relevant for most SMEs). In addition, the priority of the four additional modules (energy reporting, value chain emissions, management and resilience, and climate solutions) varies depending on the SME and the needs of the stakeholder or authority that is requesting the SME to disclose. The modular design of this framework and the recommended three-year time frame for building capacity should provide flexibility for different SMEs and data requesters to tailor the use of this framework to their disclosure needs and reporting capability. The framework is influenced by key frameworks and standards and will continue to evolve with developments in climate disclosure standards. Although this framework focuses on SME climate disclosure, there are other areas of SME disclosure that might be included in the future, such as: Carbon removals Measurable climate mitigation outcomes resulting from actions outside of a company’s value chain, such as investing in nature protection or reforestation (also referred to as ‘compensation’) Broader environmental topics (e.g., water security, deforestation, biodiversity)',\n",
