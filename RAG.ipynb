      "['Chairman: Distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, your Excellencies, please kindly take your seats. I would now like to continue our work. Please take your seats. We will start. I would now like to continue our work under Agenda item 6C, which is to make recommendations on possible norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviors relating to threats by states to space systems, including, as appropriate, how they would contribute to the negotiation of legally binding instruments, including on the prevention of an arms race in outer space. This morning, we will hopefully be able to continue our interactive and productive discussion of yesterday. With the consideration of topic one of the indicative timetable, norms, rules and principles derived from existing international legal and other normative frameworks. To aid the work of our interpreters, I kindly ask that, if possible, please send your statements to the e-mail address speeches@un.org. We have a list of speakers which is quite long and the ﬁrst speaker, El Primer Aurora, the ﬁrst speaker this morning will be the distinguished representative of Mexico. You have the ﬂoor, dear colleague.  Mexico: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Once again, allow us to thank you and Mr. Lagos and the secretariat. For all of the preparatory work to set up this session. We are delighted to have begun our substantive discussions and trust that the rest of the session will be marked by a constructive spirit. This is necessary in order to reach the agreements necessary against a complex and fragile security backdrop where it is a matter of priority to prevent behaviours that may lead to space risk. This is a space activity is essential for development of all states. The Mexican delegation appreciates the importance of this third session of our work after a review of the existing legal framework and norms that could be carried over from other legal regimes, as well as a review of the principal challenges. For space security and some new we now have the important task of looking at paths towards safer and more sustainable space through principles, rules and norms. Chairperson as a starting point in topic one as proposed in the indicative Plan, my delegation considers it necessary to draw a distinction between the diOerent categories of principles, rules and norms. Each of these has a speciﬁc and distinct dimension and scope, Albeit with essential interrelationships between them, Mexico appreciates or views the principles as the general maxims that should guide state conduct, even in the absence of particular standards governing speciﬁc behaviors. Here, my country acknowledges the full applicability of essential principles of space law and considers it important or essential rather, to keep them in totem. Our work should start on the basis of the fact that space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, should not be subject to sovereign appropriation by any state to use. An exploration of space should be carried out exclusively for peaceful ends, to the beneﬁt of all humanity. Activities should be couched in cooperation and mutual assistance, and should take into account the needs for social, economic, scientiﬁc and technological development of all states. Obviously, general principles cannot be taken in isolation. Rather, against the backdrop of a broader context of the principles of the UN Charter and other ﬁelds of international law, it is with this in mind that it is particularly important and urgent to prevent an arms race in outer space. Along with a quest for comprehensive disarmament under strict international control, Mexico. ', \"Also considers as a part of the peaceful use of space, the rejection of placements by any act and under any circumstances, in all forms of weapons, in outer space and on celestial bodies, particularly arms, with an indiscriminate or inhumane eOect, including nuclear weapons, which need to be prohibited or eliminated regardless of their class or placement. Person with regard to space law norms, these legally binding standards governing the conduct of states in space. There is a need to acknowledge the full applicability of the existing legal framework for space. The 1967 Treaty, the Outer Space Treaty, as well as the other complementary space treaties, set standards for space activities and codify and operationalize general principles, for example these rules ensure shared use of space, recognise the international responsibility of states of activities undertaken in space, be this by governmental or non-governmental bodies under their jurisdiction, whilst also putting in place measures to promote cooperation and mutual assistance and the establishment of principles of prevention, due diligence and non-prejudicial interference in 3rd party activities in general.  The aim is to put in place predictable patterns of behavior to respect the rights of third parties, and with that in mind, we echo the call of our delegations to ensure universality. My delegation appreciates, however, that the space legal framework that sought to regulate speciﬁc conduct on the basis of principles in general arose at the moment when space activities were in their infancy and very limited in number in terms of the stakeholders and actors involved. With that in mind, Mexico shares the concern expressed by various delegations in their working papers as to the need to explore the scope of the provisions in these instruments, recognising the need for more. Detail in the regulatory framework, in view of the proliferation of activities and actors with ever more sophisticated technology in space. Leading to rivalries and competition concepts such as due diligence, prevention and refraining from prejudicial interference need further precision. We should be careful, however, with the understanding of the primacy of peaceful use of space, and it's in this context that there is a need to interpret these rules and complement them if necessary. At the same time, any work on this should be done in a way which recognises the competence of Coppolas. Mexico considers that it is clear that other international law principles could be applicable to space activities. In particular, within this, groups work the applicability of international humanitarian law to any armed conﬂict situation. It should be clariﬁed, however, that its application does not endorse the use of threats of use of force or the placement of weapons, which would run counter to the principle of the peaceful use of outer space. In view of the pronouncements of the ICRC, which we support, IHL provisions are particularly relevant to, since military operations in relation with or in space could have a signiﬁcant impact on civilians on earth and as such, are of humanitarian concern. Space objects can be clearly identiﬁed as protected civilian goods and they require identiﬁcation and protection. My delegation, at the same time, continues to support the establishment of a legally binding agreement that would meet fulﬁll the principles of viability and veriﬁability. Prohibiting use of space for warlike ends, particularly banning all placement of weapons. Rules should include no Anti-satellite test Director Center Anti-satellite tests. No Counter space kinetic capacity tests and no rendezvous operations or proximity operations to the objects of third parties without their prior consent. Chair together with the legal principles the Mexican delegation appreciates the function of non-binding rules such as conﬁdence building measures. These can help to \", \"do away with erroneous perceptions and under my underlying security concerns, and they provide guarantees of the intentions, reduce the risk of undesirable involuntary conﬂict. Mexico considers these measures are relevant for space, provided that they can be considered as an interim mechanism as part of a more general process to put in place a legally binding instrument to prohibit the placement of any form of weapon in outer space. With this in mind, we are in favour of such regulations, including public exchange of information with other states on policy, strategy, doctrine, and main activities being undertaken in space, along with a provision to the eOect that all actors should participate in ensuring that space is safe. Limiting where possible, the creation of new space debris, the ﬁnal report of the Governmental Group of Experts in 2013 provides us a list of possible options here. At the same time, states should communicate with one another and notify one another in terms of ensuring and increasing physical safety and stability of space activities, resolving concerns around peace and security that may emerge through speciﬁc behaviours this particularly important. When it comes to establishing an appropriate veriﬁcation mechanism through binding standards, Mexico ﬁrst in favour of Draft resolution 7741, Destructive testing of directors sent anti-satellite missiles. We consider that this is a way of fostering. Trust on a practical basis to avoid an arms race in space. However, as we said at the time in our explanatory intervention prior to adoption, Mexico considered this measure is an interim step towards illegally abiding standards. My delegation appreciates that any eOort with a view to putting in place principles, norms and standards of responsible conduct to prevent threats in space and space systems should take into account these perspectives of all relevant stakeholders, including international organizations, entities with a special status at the General Assembly such as the ICAC, academia and industry, as well as non-governmental organisations. My delegation will carefully follow these discussions and will remain ﬂexible as to the possible outcomes, particularly, we await the necessary critical mass to lead the negotiation of new, legally binding standards to update space law in the understanding that, as we said, the existing standards should remain valid and in force. I thank you, the Chair.   Chairman: I thank the distinguished representative of Mexico for his statements. I would like to oOer the ﬂoor to the distinguished representative of the Republic of Korea. You have the ﬂoor.  Korea:  Mr. Chair, let me begin by reiterating my delegations full support for your eOorts, including the organization of this very session with your able leadership. We are now entering the second half of the open-ended working group discussion. We hope to continue the journey on that you're able to ship successfully. As my delegation presented to you in its working paper submitted to the ﬁrst session of the OEWG, the Republic of Korea believes that the working groups mandate an objective to reach a common understanding on norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviors is indeed timely, pragmatic and realistic. Timely as we live in a new space era with ever increasing actors, activities and interdependency. Pragmatic and realistic as the approach allows us the much needed ﬂexibility in responding to issues arising from dual use characteristics of space technology and are yet to be solved challenges pertaining to veriﬁcation in outer space. Throughout the \", \"last two sessions, we jointly explored what could be the most eOective way to ensure safe, secure and sustainable space activities by taking stock of the existing international norm and discussing the inherent characteristics of outer space and threats posed in this area. While we are forming, the importance of the existing international laws, such as the Outer Space Treaty and the UN Charter, as guiding principles, state simultaneously realized the limits of the existing legal and normative frameworks. By exchanging views on defaulting threat perceptions, State gained a better understanding of the complexity and subjectivity of the issues at hand. The need to update our interpretation to reﬂect the reality of space security today, for instance, on principles and concepts such as due regard, corresponding interest, harmful interference and notiﬁcations stipulated in Articles 9 and 11 of the West, was raised at the ﬁrst OWG such eOorts will contribute to strengthening the implementation of the existing international law on outer space, rather than making them irrelevant in the future. At the same time, new norms could be built overtime and form the basis for the new legally binding measure covering various threats in outer space. For us concrete examples of new norms, rules, and principles stemming from the existing principles and concepts may include a not conducting destructive direct ascent anti-satellite missile testing.  B. Operating space objects with due regard to the corresponding interests of all other states in outer space and avoiding harmful interference to the space objects of other states and C contributing to the mitigation of space debris, etc. In addition, my delegation is particularly interested in complementing a notiﬁcation mechanism to strengthen transparency and conﬁdence building measures. We believe voluntary pre activity notiﬁcation.  Will enable the states concerned to avoid miscommunication, misunderstanding and have to clarify the intention and characteristics of planned, scheduled or predicted activities in space.  Timing of the communication scope and extent of activities to be notiﬁed, process and format of such notiﬁcation can be discussed. We will share our initial thoughts under the relevant agenda. Item later in the week, along with the notiﬁcation mechanism, we also propose that we consider voluntary information sharing among states to foster additional transparency, including information on laws, policies and activities in outer space. Mr. Chair, before I conclude, I'd rather to brieﬂy share the other case recent activities on space security issues. Our calendar for last year was ﬁlled with various activities, including a presentation at the UNDC in March, a virtual conference with the Unidir and Secure World Foundation with ASEAN countries last May and the Arrow Key UN conference on Space Security in November. The summary report of the two aforementioned conferences are available through the OWG website. We are also glad to announce that the ARC founded space security portal to support transparency, information sharing, and capacity building will have its soft launch event by Unidire tomorrow. We look forward to your active participation in the project. With these remarks, my dear Leaders stand ready to work within the OWG to develop practical and feasible recommendations on possible norms, rules, and principles of responsible behaviors. We look forward to substantive discussion at this session. Thank you, Mr. Chair.  Chairman: I thank the distinguished representative of the Republic of Korea for her statement. Yeah, continuation I'm delighted to give the ﬂoor to the distinguished representative of Cuba. You have the ﬂoor. \", \"Cuba: Thank you, Chairman. We reiterate Cuba's willingness to participate constructively in the work of this group and to collaborate as we endeavour to achieve successful results. Chair space should be used in line with international law to the beneﬁt of all nations, regardless of their level of development, guaranteeing its peaceful use at all times. In my delegation's opinion, these are core provisions of the existing legal frameworks which need to be reaOirmed as part of the standard setting work being, done by the OWG, my country recognises the value and relevance of the legal regime that prevails internationally in this topic and we promote the strict adherence to treaties and principles on activities of States and exploring and use of space for peaceful ends. That said, we recognise that the applicable legal regime in this area does not per SE guarantee the prevention of an arms race in outer space, meaning that there is a need for it to be consolidated and bolstered in order to guarantee security and transparency in the undertaking of space activities. Chairman, the elaboration of norms, rule and standards should be a midway step towards a legally binding instrument. Any voluntary measure we agree on should be considered by all as a midpoint step that does not replace the need for binding standards to strengthen security and predictability in space activities. This should necessarily include an express prohibition on the placement of weapons of any form in space, in our view. This should be a rule about which we can all agree on which there is already a legally binding draft, the draft treaty table by China and Russia in 2014 to the CD. Here in particular, we reaOirm the importance of the commitment on no ﬁrst placement in space, which our country has shouldered. We call upon states who have yet to do so to do so as soon as possible, particularly those who are engaged in activities in space and have the capacity to do so. Chairman. The establishment of new rules, standards and principles. On a voluntary basis should not deny states the legitimate right to beneﬁt from space technology for peaceful ends depending on the level of development, on an equal footing without any form of discrimination. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967, the 1963 Declaration of Legal Principles and the Declaration on International Cooperation in Space, using exploration of 1993, provide as such. We reiterate, therefore, that any new normal or principle. Should be in a position to ensure that all are enabled to have access to space and not denied it in any way. They should have full, eOective participation and should not in any way be prejudice in the medium or long term. Chairperson. We consider that in promoting space as a universal part of the Patrick Humanity. We would be urging space actors to ensure its protection on an eOective basis, leading to peaceful use of space and a reduction of threat any agreement on normed rules and principles for responsible behaviour in relation to space threats should be undertaken on the basis of contributions from all states, taking into account the varying levels of capacity of actors involved. In this, we should avoid distortion, multiple interpretations and harmful reinterpretation of the existing legal framework Chairman. It is a matter of common responsibility to avoid space becoming a backdrop for armed conﬂict. This would seriously undermine, if not destroy, the foreign promising future prospects of space applications for sustainable development of the human species and might even challenge the existence of humanity itself. In our view, the greatest threat that we face is the growing militarisation of space and the placement of weapons in space. This has to be the focus of our eOorts here. We condemn activities with military purposes in space, development of oOensive capacity and the declaration of space as a new terrain for \", \"warfare, and the establishment of military units for this end. As a result of this Group, we should be able to come up with midpoint provisions which can help us to bring an end to this form of action as we move towards illegally binding instruments. I thank you, the Chair.   Chairman: I thank the distinguished Representative Cuba for her statement. Give the ﬂoor to the distinguished representative of Sweden.  Sweden: To Chair and let me once again voice my delegations appreciation for the way that you steer the work of this open-ended working group and to assure you of my delegation's continued cooperation and support. I also want to thank you, Chair, for the draft paper with the possible elements summing up discussions so far and outlining the issues at hand, and we will contribute some views on this in writing before the set deadline. I also wish to thank those delegations which have contributed with working papers to this session and the earlier ones. They contain many interesting proposals and ideas which we will come back to, and my delegation looks forward to interesting and fruitful discussions in the days to come and Sweden fully aligns itself with the statement of the European Union to be delivered. I just want to add a few comments in a national capacity. Sweden remains strongly committed to strengthening International Security and safety and to the prevention of an arms race in outer space which is essential for safeguarding the long term use of the space environment for peaceful purposes. We are therefore fully supportive of the establishment of and the work of the OEWG, which we believe is a pragmatic and constructive step in building common understanding of what constitutes responsible behaviour and irresponsible behaviour in outer space and how various aspects of this can be addressed? We believe that agreeing on voluntary norms of responsible behavior constitutes the best way forward at this moment, without excluding the possibility of future legally binding measures.  We believe that it's important and pertinent to discuss and agree on norms, rules and principles to reduce threats and risks, achieve increased transparency and predictability, contribute to conﬁdence building, a risk reduction, increase security, prevent an arms race in outer space, and to prevent unintended escalation of conﬂicts. Sweden regards after space as a global comment to be used for the beneﬁt of all, and we underline the applicability of international law, including the UN Charter, AUN treaties on outer space and international humanitarian law, to activities in outer space and when planning, developing and executing space activities, states must do so in accordance with their obligations under international law, and it's important that the further development of norms, rules and guidelines take this into account. Regarding threats and risks, as Sweden has stated before, we believe that there are a number of actions that could constitute irresponsible behaviors, such as, for instance, the deliberate creation of space debris through the use of kinetic force against space systems. Rendezvous and proximity operations carried out without prior consent and non-kinetic threats against space systems, for instance threats to systems that may damage vital functions of operational control of a satellite, disturb or disrupt space-based services or in other ways jeopardize the safety and security of people, goods or infrastructures, and we would like to see norms developed to address these threats. Sweden, like many others, supported the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 77 slash 41 on destructive direct descent anti \", \"satellite missile testing and we welcome commitments made so far by several UN member states not to conduct such tests. Such commitments are positive concrete steps towards strengthening International Security, safety and long-term sustainability of space activities. And when discussing and developing norms, rules, and guidelines of responsible behavior, it's important to take into account the essential work conducted in other formats, For instance, the Committee on Peaceful Uses of Address Base COPAS and its Working Group on Long Term Sustainability Guidelines, while at the same time recognizing and respecting the mandates and roles of diOerent fora. We very much appreciate the inclusive approach of the work of the open-ended working group so far and we see the invaluable contributions by an involvement of stakeholders such as international organizations, civil society and commercial actors, whose presence in space activities are ever increasing. In summing up, there are many interesting suggestions that have been presented and we look forward to constructive and fruitful discussions at laying the ground for the next and last sessions, where we hope it will be possible to agree on recommendations on rules, norms and principles. Thank you very much.  Chairman: I thank the distinguished representative of Sweden for her statement, and now I would like to give the ﬂoor to the distinguished representative of Turkey.  Turkey: Thank you, Mr. Chair. We would like to express our gratitude to you for your unwavering eOorts. We assure you of our delegation support in your endeavors. We reiterate that Turkey attached particular importance to protecting the right of unrestricted access and tool and use of outer space for peaceful purposes. Turkey Co-sponsored the UN General Assembly resolutions, reducing Space Threats through norms, Rules and Principles of Responsive behaviors and Destructive Direct Anti Satellite Missile testing. We are after we have debt open-ended working group will beneﬁt from the increased cooperation with the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Other Space. We welcome the convening of joint panels by the 1st and 4th Committees on Space Safety and Sustainability last October.  We also thank you and your team for preparing A comprehensive paper containing possible elements on items 6A and B, which we are still evaluating. Mr. Chair, regarding our views on the ﬁrst topic. The other speciality established the basic legal framework for order space. Clearly, it stated that other space is not subject to national appropriation or solely parsing. National interest and activities in outer space must be for the beneﬁt and welfare of all countries. The Registration convention of 1975 requires states to register their space objects with the United Nations. In this regard, non-transparent meter space projects should be avoided in outdoor space. UN General Assembly resolutions such as Declaration on International Cooperation in the Exploration, Exploration and Use of other Space for the Beneﬁt and the Interest of States taken into particular account the needs of developing countries in 1997 creates norms of softball which are guiding these states. Thank you, Mr. Chair.  Chairman: I thank the distinguished representative of Turkey for his statement. And now I would like to oOer the ﬂoor to the distinguished representative and my personal friend. Representative of Pakistan. You have the ﬂoor. \", 'Pakistan: Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. At the outset we would like to appreciate your work, your eOorts in steering this open-ended working group and assure you of our constructive engagement. We also thank you for circulation of your paper earlier on the elements and we look forward to submitting our feedback in writing before the stipulated deadline. Chairman, We would also like to thank Unidire for the compilation on role of norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour for Space security and other Member States for circulating their proposals. Mr. Chairman, with this third meeting, the OEWG enters into a critical phase where it is expected to delve deeper in its consideration of an array of issues pertaining to outer space security, including possible recommendations which could contribute to the negotiation of legally binding instruments, including on the prevention of an arms race in outer space, in our view, these recommendations. Whether in the form of norms, rules, or principles or otherwise, would have to satisfy the following metrics to be considered meaningful. An unequivocal reaOirmation of existing International Space law and the principles contained therein, facilitate the universalization of the existing 5 core international treaties related to outer space. Three, they should be non-discriminatory and equitable and not be developed with a view to legitimizing and preserving the advanced weapon capabilities of spacefaring nations. Four, they should contribute to formulation of additional internationally binding rules in the domain of outer space, aimed at prevention of arms race in outer space and reversing the ongoing weaponization of outer space. Five, they should not negatively impact the right of access for peaceful uses of outer space, especially for emerging spacefaring nations, and rather facilitate such endeavours. 6 They should aOirm the cardinal principle of ensuring equal security for all States and the primary responsibility of states with signiﬁcant military capabilities visibly prevention of an arms race in outer space. Mr. Chairman, during previous meetings of the OEWG, our delegation outlined an entire range of threats faced by the international community, manifested most clearly in the form of an unabated arms race and increasing weaponization of outer space. We also pointed out to the necessity of avoiding piece meal approaches to security in outer space and the imperative of following a comprehensive approach. Thus, it is essential that the OWG addresses the full spectrum of threats while discussing recommendations on the possible normative framework. In this context, we thank you for circulating the updated integrative timetable and the list of topics it covers, and for issuing the revised version yesterday. We note that this provides a good basis for our discussions without limiting the rights of states to cover additional elements as part of our discussions as well as recommendations. So as to ensure that the OEWG makes progress comprehensively and meaningfully. While being very mindful of the language of Op ﬁve of resolution 76231, we must also remain cognizant of the non-consensual nature of the paragraph and that over the course of this OEWG delegations have pointed out existing threats that go beyond to the space systems security alone. It goes without saying that all states, even those who may not have any space assets or systems in outer space will be aOected from a conﬂict in outer space. Given the global reliance on this common in our view, therefore, the framing of space security to only security of space systems is tenuous at best and cannot constitute as the only marker informing our discussions and recommendations. Let us make no mistake that the greatest threats related to outer space result from the ideology and policies that consider this ', 'domain as a new war ﬁghting frontier and through actions and developments that are leading to weaponization of outer space by number parameter, this could be considered as a responsible behavior. Mr. Chairman, on the ﬁrst topic, the OEWG should reaOirm the applicability of existing legal framework, including the UN Charter, and uphold the principles and obligations of all ﬁve UN space treaties. Through this OEWG, the state should aOirm the applicability of Article 2 four of the UN Charter in outer space.  To refrain from the threat or use of force. In addition, we believe the OWG. Should aOirm in particular Article One of Outer Space Treaty that I quote. The exploration and use of outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, shall be carried out for the beneﬁt and interest of all countries, irrespective of their degree of economic or scientiﬁc development, and shall be the province of all mankind. UN quote. There is great interest of States in preserving outer space for peaceful purposes. The OWG should consider evolving A normative framework. To that end, while reaOirming the existing legal framework applicable in outer space, we also expect the OEWG to deliberate on how our discussions here can advance eOective and veriﬁable legally binding agreements aimed at preventing an arms race in outer space. We look forward to contributing to this end under the various topics proposed by you through the course of this OEWGI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Chairman: I thank the distinguished representative of Pakistan for his statement, and I would like to give the four to the distinguished representative of Switzerland. You have the ﬂoor, Sir.  Switzerland: Mr. President, Chair sizzling would like to remind you that international law, including the UN Charter, apply to outer space as well, including the Moon and other celestial bodies as in resolution. 122116 and Article 3 on the Outer Space Treaty. This speciﬁcally concerns the prohibition of any threat or use of force in Article 2 power of four of the UN Charter. The threat on use of force by a state against spatial systems of another country is prohibited. Regarding the right to legitimate defense in Article 51 of the UN Charter, this is applicable but must not be exercised in space. It must only be exercised in a very limited manner. There can be no justiﬁcation of reprisals committed in space and reaction to a terrestrial conﬂict. Or an action of So-called preventative legitimate defense. Moreover, there are a number of commitments and binding principles that must be applied in terms of the outer space. First of all, the prohibition of placing of targeting any outer space bodies, celestial bodies or placing nuclear launchers or any weapons of mass destruction. This is in accordance with para four of the article. Secondly, the principle of peaceful use of the moon and other celestial bodies, as well as the prohibition of establishing bases, their installations or military fortiﬁcations. With weapons of any kind, in accordance with Article 4, Part 2, third the obligations under Article 9 of this Treaty for spacefaring nations to adhere to the principle of cooperation and mutual assistance in all their activities in outer space. Including the moon and other celestial bodies keeping an account the rights of all parties to this Treaty in cases of armed conﬂict, military operations and space must adhere to international humanitarian law. We would like to reiterate the position of the International Court of Justice in accordance with which the establishing principles of international humanitarian law apply to all forms of warfare and all weapons ', \"as of the past and of the present and future. We must emphasize the foundation principles of international humanitarian law of distinction, proportionality and precaution. Furthermore, we would like to explicitly mention that these principles of international humanitarian law also apply to kinetic and non-kinetic operations. Regarding the respect of international humanitarian law in space, Switzerland would like to underline that the risk of collateral damage, both direct and indirect. To civilians and civilian objects on land, and the risk of creation of damage and to both civilian targets and other objects must be taken into consideration. The situation raises serious questions when it comes to the issue of whether military operations and space, in particular the use of methods of combat, could have a kinetic eOect and impact international humanitarian law with regard to the applicability of IHL, Switzerland would like to reiterate that IHL concerned the realities of armed conﬂict. Regardless of the motives or the legitimacy of the use of force, this does not legitimize the use of armed force in space. Quite the contrary, IHL imposes signiﬁcant limitations on any use of force in space. IHL does not provide any response to the issue of legitimacy of conﬂict and does not legitimize any use of force between states. The goal is to regulate hostilities and protect the victims of armed conﬂict. Primarily by using by limiting the methods of warfare Chair There are a number of diOerent principles that stem from the Outer Space Treaty. The most pertinent for Switzerland are the following Article one of the treaties guarantees free access to outer space without discrimination and in the context of equality, as well as the exploration and full and comprehensive use of address space for peaceful goals at any time. Article 4 Power One of the Outer Space Treaty, stipulate the prohibition of placement of nuclear weapons or any other WMD's in outer space the principle of non-interference. In accordance with Article 9 of the Treaty, the principles that stem from Article One of the Outer Space Treaty and the reﬂections on IHL lead Switzerland to conclude that any activities in space. Particularly, military operations cannot impact the freedom of other states to use space or to enter into conﬂict, or impact the enjoyment of any other rights, such as special exploration or access to space for peaceful uses. Thank you.  Chairman: I thank the distinguished representative of Switzerland for his statement. And now I would like to oOer the ﬂoor to the distinguished representative of Brazil. You have the ﬂoor, Sir.  Brazil: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My delegation retreats its appreciation to you for the preparations for this session and for your skilled leadership since the beginning of this work. Brazil believes that these OEWG represents a unique opportunity to further the objective of preventing conﬂict in outer space. That objective is well served by the inclusive and participatory nature of this body, which reﬂects the fact that the security and stability of outer space is a matter of critical importance to all states. This is particularly true for developing countries and aspiring spacefaring nations, which are yet far from fully enjoying the beneﬁts to be accrued from the peaceful exploration of that environment. Since this is our ﬁrst meeting after the adoption of resolution 77 slash 250 which established a new group of governmental experts on Paris. We would like to express our hope that the new GG will represent an opportunity to translate the recommendations of these OEWG into the \", 'groundwork for future progress on a possible legally binding treaty on Paris. For this to happen, however, we must ensure that both 4 seek to complement each other. A division of labour and genuine engagement of all states in both four are crucial ingredients for this work. The experience of the GGE ON and OEWG on cybersecurity provides a very useful reference in this regard. Mr. Chairman, turning now to the ﬁrst topic proposed in our indicative timetable norms, rules and principles derived from existing international legal and other normative frameworks, my delegation wishes to oOer the following remarks. Fundamentally, Brazil reaOirms that any recommendations made by the President OEWG should be based on the principles set forth by the existing international legal framework, both from general international law and from the treaties and conventions speciﬁcally related to outer space. Regarding general principles of international law, the recommendation of the OA Double G should be oriented by the obligations established by the UN Charter, notably. Regard to the prohibition of the threat or use of force and the right of self-defense, as well as by the principles of international humanitarian law, in particular those of precaution, proportionality and distinction, the UWG should aim at clarifying how these would be translated into practice given the speciﬁcities of the space environment. Such clariﬁcations should contribute to the preservation of outer space as a peaceful environment by highlighting the inherent risks associated with any use of force in outer space. In this sense, the working paper tabled by the International Committee of the Red Cross oOers valid and useful considerations on the subject and could inform our recommendations in this area. As for speciﬁc international law and on outer space, COA Double G should recognize the validity of the legally binding principles established by the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 and build upon them. These include the Principles on the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for the Beneﬁts and, in the interests of all countries, the legal obligation not to place nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction in orbit. The obligation to ensure that Outer Space shall be free for the exploration in use by all States, the responsibility of States for national space activities, the liability of States for damage caused by their Space objects, and the obligation of States to avoid harmful contamination of Space and Celestial bodies, and last but not least, the legal obligation of due regard. The OWG should also take into account the obligation set forth by Derivative, Derivative, and Supplementary Treaties on outer Space, such as those established by the 1968 Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts, the 1972 Liability Convention and the 1976 Convention on the Registration of Space Objects. The same applies to non-binding guidelines adopted in the context of the Committee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, in particular the Space Debris mitigation guidelines and the long term sustainability guidelines. Furthermore, Brazil also believes that the OWG could beneﬁt from analogies with other branches of international law dedicated to the regulation of common goods, such as the law of the sea and international environmental law. Especially with regards to the concepts of due diligence and due regard, the presidents from these bodies of law would help us clarify the inferred obligation not to alter the outer space environment in ways that would harm the accessibility and peaceful exploration of outer space. This notion is also underpinned by Article 9 of the OST by Articles 35 and 55. Of the Additional Protocol to the Additional Protocol One to the Geneva Conventions and by Articles One and Two of the 1978 Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Hostile Use of ', \"Environmental Modiﬁcation Techniques and MOD. In conclusion, Mr. Chair, Brazil believes that the OWG should seek to reaOirm the validity of these principles and to recommend norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour that contribute to the compliance with this body of law and to reinforce its positive impact on safety and security of outer space. In so doing, the OE Double G will hopefully lay a solid groundwork for a future binding instrument on Paris. Thank you, Mr. Chair.  Chairman: I thank the distinguished representative of Brazil for his statement and now I would like to oOer the ﬂoor to the distinguished representative of Australia. You have the ﬂoor.  Australia: Thank you, Chair. My delegation wishes to extend our gratitude to you and the Secretariat for organizing and engaging agenda for this week. We look forward to fruitful discussions. We'd also like to thank you for your paper. We will give it consideration and provide feedback. Chair at the outset allow me to frame Australia's approach going into this session of the open-ended working group. As you know, we seek to make recommendations on possible non-binding norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviours relating to threats by states to space systems, as we identiﬁed in the last session, irresponsible behaviors can increase the risk of miscalculation and misperception. Agreement on these concerns, the threats and irresponsible behaviors, is foundational to our work. As this will identify the behaviors we need to look at behaviors of transparency and openness, behaviors that make a positive contribution to space security and which reduce the chance for miscalculation. In some cases, it may be better to cease certain behaviors to ensure ongoing peace and security. Chair Australia feels the draft paper you distributed on the possible elements for agendas Item 6A and 6B summarised last session's discussions on threats and irresponsible behaviours very well. Our task for this session is to clarify non-binding norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour which can address the threats and irresponsible behaviors which we collectively identiﬁed in the last session. A successful example of this approach is the US-led commitment not to conduct destructive direct dissent anti-satellite missile tests. Given that the generation of large amounts of long-lived debris is a commonly identiﬁed concern, it follows that we must develop norms of responsible behavior that can address this irresponsible behavior. 30.99: Last year's United Nations First Committee meeting demonstrated widespread support for this emerging norm of responsible behaviour, which addresses not only the debris concern but also concerns around the destabilising nature of these weapons tests. 31.15: Many states, including Australia, have also made unilateral political declarations committing not to undertake this irresponsible behaviour. As an international community, we've gone from identifying a concern in the space domain to implementing speciﬁc commitments to improve the safety, security and sustainability of space for all. This is the value of the responsible behaviours approach, and we hope for similar progress to be made throughout this session. Chair Turning now to the topic at hand, Australia wishes to re endorse and reaOirm the abundance of extant legal frameworks. Australia is a signatory to all 5 space treaties including the Outer Space Treaty. We encourage all space varying nations to sign and comply with these treaties. In the context of this open-ended working \", \"group, Australia wishes to particularly reaOirm the following key obligations of those treaties. The exploration and use of outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, shall be carried out for the beneﬁt and in the interests of all countries. All site activities shall be guided by the principle of cooperation and mutual assistance. Outer space shall be free for the exploration and use by all states, If the state has reason to believe that an activity would cause potentially harmful interference with those activities of other states, it must ﬁrst undertake appropriate international consultations. States shall avoid the harmful contamination of Earth and other celestial bodies with extraneous matter. Australia recognises that international law, including the UN Charter, applies to the exploration and use of space and that all states should behave consistently with their international obligations when carrying out activities in the exploration and use of outer space. In relation to international humanitarian law, Australia considers, considers it likely that certain customary international law obligations, which do not have any territorial limitations, apply to armed conﬂict conducted in, from, to, or through outer space. The recognition of this does not promote or pre-empt conﬂict in space. On the contrary, it reminds us that if conﬂict occurs in from and through outer space, there is existing international law which regulates how that occurs and noted the importance and continued relevance of existing legal frameworks. We also acknowledge the gaps which time and advancing technology have created in these frameworks. The last session of the open-ended working group demonstrated there are behaviours that are not prohibited by existing legal framework but they do raise tensions and lead to possible miscalculation. Disease gaps we are seeking to address through the work of this open-ended working group. Through developing non-binding norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour. Such non-binding approaches can complement international law by allowing the international community to set expectations regarding the conduct of certain space activities. Which, even if lawful, may pose a risk of misunderstanding, escalation, or conﬂict. Chair, Pursuant to addressing these gaps in previous sessions, we have discussed drawing insight from other frameworks in Australia's 2021 submission to the Secretary General's report on Resolution 7536 on reducing space threats. Through norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviours, we propose that we establish clear communication and information exchange protocols for when satellites are operating near to each other. We noted that states had developed voluntary basic communication and information exchange protocols for Wednesday's encounter each other in other domains. In the Maritime Domain, we cited the 2014 Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea queues, a non-binding agreement that serves to reduce tensions and prevent incidents at sea by increasing transparency and communication. Delegates may recall Miss Ortega from Unadier discussing both queues and the Incident at Sea Agreement as mechanisms to further contribute to reducing tensions and prevent incidents at sea. We see great value in examining existing non-binding norms, rules and principles within comparable domains to inform our discussions on responsible behaviours in the space domain. Chair In addition to examining other frameworks, Australia continues to support the implementation of previously established normative frameworks, such as the recommendations of the 2013 GGE on transparency and conﬁdence building measures and the Guidelines for the Long-Term Sustainability of Outer Space activities. We also note the extensive discussion on \", \"potential norms, rules and principles of responsible behavior that has already taken place within the international community and would like to take the chance to state our suggestions. For potential non-binding norms of responsible behavior in peacetime based on these initial frameworks. They are states should commit to not conduct destructive direct dissent anti-satellite missile testing. States should operate in from, through and to space safely. States should avoid endangering the lives of humans in space. States should avoid creating harmful interference. States should avoid creating long lived orbital debris. States should publish information about national space policies, strategies, doctrine, expenditure and major activities. States should communicate and make notiﬁcations to enhance the safety and stability of space activities and ﬁnally, states should establish, maintain and utilize communication channels to resolve concerns about international peace and security that arise from space activities.  Chair, we are heartened to see the alignment of these potential norms with those proposed in statements and working papers and many other nations. We're also pleased to see support for concrete path towards implementing vital norms and TCBMS such as the Uniderer Space Policy Portal. Thank you for your attention.   Chairman: I thank the distinguished representative for Australia for his statement and now oOer the ﬂoor. To the distinguished representative of Singapore, you have the ﬂoor.  Singapore: Mr. Chair. Mr. Chair. The Delegation of Singapore would like to express our gratitude to you and the Secretary for the excellent organization of this OEWG. Singapore would also like to thank you for providing a useful overview of the OE WG's progress thus far in the Chair Summary of Discussions from the previous session of this OWG Session. Singapore aligns itself with the statement delivered by Indonesia on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Singapore recognizes the importance of preserving outer space as a peaceful global Commons to be harnessed with a collective beneﬁt of humankind. We continue to support eOorts to promote a rules-based approach to the responsible use of space by all such an approach allows many countries, including Singapore, to depend on space-based technologies and applications to support important government functions and daily activities. Services and industries that rely on space-based infrastructure and technology include aviation, maritime navigation, mapping and surveying, disaster management, food security, communications, telemedicine, environment monitoring and natural resources management. It is just imperative that Member States work together to reduce space threats. Preserve Outer space as a peaceful global Commons the Singapore Delegation believes that small states have a role to play and can make meaningful contributions in the promotion of the peaceful uses of outer space. By participating in this OEWG on reducing space threats through norms, rules, and principles of responsible behaviors, Singapore strongly supports discussions on best practices, norms, rules, and standards that apply to space activities. We look forward to continuing such discussions in the course of this week as this O UW G meets for its third session. Singapore supports the full implementation of applicable international law instruments, including the UN treaties in outer space. Singapore further underscores the importance of relevant General Assembly resolutions, including the resolutions on \", \"destructive direct ascent, anti-satellite testing, on no ﬁrst placement of weapons in outer space, and on further practical measures with the prevention of an armed racing out to space. Mr. Chair, I wish to reiterate Singapore's full commitment to contributing to this OEWGS work under your guidance, and I hope that this week's discussions will be productive towards development of a set of norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour in outer space. Thank you.  Chairman: I thank the distinguished representative of Singapore for her statement, and now I would like to give the ﬂoor to the distinguished representative of the United Arab Emirates. You have the ﬁrst, Sir.  United Arab Emirates: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Distinguished delegates, the United Arab Emirates welcomes the third session of the open-ended working group and believes that the valuable outcomes of our discussions will contribute into creating a safe, secure and sustainable out of space environment. On this occasion, we would like to assure our commitment to supporting decisions that maintain the peaceful uses of outer space and the long-term sustainability of space activities and space environment. The UAE does not consider space activities as a race. We look at it as an area that enables international cooperation, builds capabilities, and serves humankind Considering the importance of space accessibility, the UAE supports ﬁnding common norms that will minimize current risks without enforcing any instruments that could limit US or any other country from building capabilities and space systems. Distinguished delegates, the United Arab Emirates assures its full support and look forward to working actively with all delegations to ensure fair and successful outcomes. We believe that the recommendations of the Group of Governmental Experts on transparency and conﬁdence building measures such as exchanging information about space policies, space systems, development programs, objects on Earth orbits, states, principles and goals regarding the exploration and use of outer space will help on increasing transparency and reduce military tension in space. There is an urgent need to strengthen trust and transparency between states, and such a need cannot be satisﬁed without collective and collaborative eOort from all to achieve global peace and security. We believe in the importance of the coordination and involvement of intergovernmental organisations and relevant working groups, including the United Nations OOice for Disarmament AOairs, the open-ended Working Group, the Committee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, and the United Nations OOice for Outer Space AOairs when drafting the ﬁnal recommendations and work plans concerning reducing space threats. In addition, to encourage communications and coordination between the relevant UN bodies, we propose that you, Mr. Chair, to invite representatives from the United Nations OOice for Outer Space AOairs. For peaceful users after and the Committee for Peaceful Uses of Outer Space to attend the open-ended working group meetings as observers. To this end, we urge we urge all states to work closely together to achieve the goal of this group and reducing space threats through norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour. Thank you, Mr. Chair. \", \"United Arab Emirates: I thank the distinguished representative of the United Arab Emirates for the statement, and now I would like to give the ﬂoor to the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation. You have the ﬂoor.  Russian: The distinguished representative of the Russian Federation has the ﬂoor. Mr. Chairman at the outset Allow me to welcome the constructive bent of delegations, as demonstrated yesterday. With regards to the continuation of the meeting of the third session of the working group and the transition to discussion on substantive issues, issues of substance Who? There is one organizational matter, which you're all familiar with, that we have postponed for the time being. It is to be hoped that consultations will happen with all interested countries in order to try to reach some form of resolution on this issue. Of course, a consensus-based solution as set forth in our mandate and in the meantime it is to be heard that. All will refrain from any actions that may inﬂuence this issue against the bad drop of the holding of this third session of the working group with regards to substantive issues and speciﬁcally topic one Which is currently being discussed by the working group and which is included in the indicative timetable as proposed by the Chair, we would like to underscore that the joint action of all UN Member States in order to enhance the exact existing legal basin connection with the regulation of space security is ever more necessary in order to prevent space becoming a launching point for aggression and war, we can see extremely dangerous. Any steps aimed at using outer space for military operations, fueled by a desire to impose military primacy. They are having an extremely negative inﬂuence on international peace and security and run the risk of destabilisation of the situation and in arms racing out of space, which would very much undermine prospects for limiting and reducing arms overall. In this connection, we renew our call for all states to aOirm a commitment to existing international norms and principles. Governing activities in space In particular, I am talking here about the UN Charter. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967. The treaty banning nuclear weapons testing in the atmosphere, in outer Space, and underwater of 1963. The Declaration on Legal Principles for Actions by States in Exploration and Use of Outer Space of 1963. The convention on the International Responsibility or Liability, Conventional Damage by Space Subjects, 1972, and the Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modiﬁcation Techniques of 1977. We would record the key provisions of these treaties. Which are of particular value and should be of particular attention to the international community. As such, Article Two of the UN Charter enshrines the principle of refraining from international relations, from the threat of force or use thereof, including in space, from space or in relation to space pursuant to Article Three of the Outer Space Treaty and paragraph four of the Declaration of Legal Principles of Actions by States in Exploration and Use of Outer Space shall carry on activities in the exploration and use of outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, in accordance with international law, including the United Nations Charter, in the interest of maintaining international peace and security, and promoting international cooperation and understanding. Article Four of the Space Treaty provides that state commit not to place an orbit around the Earth, any object carrying nuclear weapons, or any other forms of weapons of mass destruction not install such weapons on heavenly bodies or or station weapons in space in other in any other \", \"manner. The moon and other celestial bodies should be used exclusively for peaceful ends moreover, article one of the treaties on Prohibiting of the nuclear testing atmosphere in space and underwater. Of course, one states prohibits not to carry out nuclear weapons test explosions or any other nuclear explosions at any place under its jurisdiction or control in the atmosphere. Beyond its limits, including outer space underwater, including territorial waters or the high seas. Article Four of the space treaty also prohibits the establishment of military bases Installations and fortiﬁcations, the testing of any type of weapons and the conduct military maneuvers on celestial bodies.  It does permit the use of military personnel for scientiﬁc research or other peaceful ends and any equipment for exploration of the moon and other celestial bodies. In accordance with Article One of the conventions on the Prohibition of Military on the Other Hostile Use Environmental Modiﬁcation Techniques States are obliged not to resort to military or any other harmful use of environmental modiﬁcation techniques with a broad long term or serious consequence, including causing harm to any other Member State. At the same time, UN member states recognize interior as per a number of original assembly resolutions that. In contemporary in current space law, there are many lacunae which require dealing with. Therefore, together with reaOirming the existing international legal principles pertaining to space, there is a need for steps to bolster this legal framework in connection with activities in space and ﬁrst and foremost, at preventing an arms race in space. It's necessary clearly to underscore That such measures to bolster the existing legal framework for space activities against the backdrop of their eOorts to prevent an arms race in out space adding out space, should not in any way be considered as a revision or review of these existing standards of international opportunity to space. It's not a review of the standard these. Norms remain in force and should not be changed.  It's simply complementary additional work to bolster those. Norms in order to address the lacuna to exist in international law. We therefore reaOirm our core position that similar non-binding principles law rules. Can only complement but not replace legally binding Instruments as part of the paras endeavors and also international legal norms which are in force within the framework of space law in relation to activities in space in this connection. As a matter of priority, there is a need to Ensure the Internet the international community and its activities involving Earth omits and tablet parties. Is not involved placement of weapons in any form, as has been indicated by the vast majority of states, as we've heard from delegations. There should also be a ban on the use of force and threat of force in connection with space object and their use. With a comprehensive ban on space oOensive weapons to attack space objects, such actions. Would enable us in practice, to put in place a comprehensive, legally binding instrument. Leaking towards paras, we are convinced of the need Not to review the 1978 decision aimed at ensuring exploration and use of space for purely peaceful purposes preventing an arm racing out of space. It is important that space not in ever anyway be used as a place for weapons and it’s protected for peaceful purposes Free for research and use by all UN member states without any exception whatsoever. This should have become Universally recognized principle in the absence of reliable guarantees of protection of space. From weapons, as enshrined in international legal banning instruments on Paris, the resolution of issues in connection with the peaceful use of space and guarantees of security for space activity will not lead anywhere the basis for such an instrument. Could be the draft Russian China \", \"Treaty on the Prevention Arms Race in Outer Space and the Use of Force or Threat of Force against Space objects against the backdrop of the issues being reviewed by the open-ended working group, we aOirm our position as to the counter productiveness of reviewing the applicability of international humanitarian law to the actions of states in outer space Ihl. Is intended for application in armed conﬂict with a speciﬁc object, the protection of victims of anti-conﬂict, and rules for that conﬂict discussions as the applicability or inapplicability of IHL. To space automatically lead to the conclusion that there is a real possibility about conﬂict arising in space, moreover such a consideration would directly run counter to international law, whereby activities undertaken in space and celestial bodies can only take place for peaceful purposes. Our country's position? Is set out in the working document for the Russian Federation, which we have made available for this session.  I would request that all delegations familiarize themselves with this document. Space is a place where there should be no conﬂict that is the purpose of our eOorts or should be in as we seek to develop norms aimed at preventing emergency conﬂict in space. This is key to achieving the goal of prevention and arms race in outer space when it comes to the suite of issues around. Rule setting and regulation of activities in space for peaceful and this is considered by Corpus and in particularly the legal Subcommittee. This Legal Subcommittee. Is the main forum for discussion and decision making across a broad range of space law issues such as the in view of the broadening range of space, activities exist. They are ever more stakeholders. Technology is being developed and it's leading to new potential. Conﬂicts and contradictions in space from this point of view the agenda of the Legal Subcommittee of Cockroach is ever more relevant and this is to which the general exchange of information and opinions on legal mechanisms in connection to measures to reduce potential conﬂict in space, bearing in mind the work of the Scientiﬁc Subcommittee, as well as exchange of opinions on possible models for legal regulation of space activities as well as research and use of resources. In addition, on the subcommittee's agenda, there has been for many years a series of items such as the status implementation of the ﬁve UN space treaties, national legislation with a relation to exploration and use of space for peaceful ends Fostering potential in terms of space law as well as exchange of information on UN illegally branding documents on space in this way the development of the international legal base for peaceful space activity. Is strictly within the remit of corpus and requires further discussion within the framework of that specialized forum with that doubling of eOorts. The resolution of Paris issues and the work of the ﬁrst committee of the UN First Committee Initiative, of which this group was set up. Well, this is also having a close relation to the work attempts to remove this issue from the cop who has forum were to remove the core role of this forum and would be counterproductive. I thank you for your attention.  Chairman: I thank the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation for his statement. And now I would like to oOer the ﬂoor to the distinguished ambassador of Italy. You have the ﬂoor, Sir.  Italy: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Italy fully aligns with a statement to be delivered by the European Union. I would like to add some remarks in my national capacity, and we \", 'appreciate your eOorts in preparing the Chair, Summary and Elements paper. We look forward to further substantive discussions this week and believe that these discussions are already providing A valuable contribution to our common goal of preventing an arms race in outer space, Mr. Chair. We believe there is an urgent need for greater international cooperation to improve space security and prevent an arms race in outer space. In an increasingly congested, contested and competitive space environment. We place a high emphasis on addressing potential escalation dynamics and security threats to safeguard the long-term use of space of the space environment for peaceful purposes on an equitable and mutually acceptable basis. The existing international framework applicable to outer space needs to be strengthened to address the complexity of space risks and threats. This means, ﬁrst of all, recognizing and protecting the integrity of the existing legal framework. At the same time, we are convinced that voluntary, non-legally binding rules and measures can actually help us increase stability and predictability and prevent outer space from becoming an arena of conﬂict. Norms, rules and principles of responsible behavior, including transparency and conﬁdence building measures in outer space activities can complement the existing legal framework governing space activities. In addition, they can serve as non-binding tools for the gradual evolution of international law and can be an important intermediate step in maximizing the chances of a successful outcome of future negotiations for a binding treaty. We therefore believe that norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour should build upon, on the one hand, on the applicability of international law in outer space, including the Charter of the United Nations, International Humanitarian Law and the four core treaties on outer space. In this regard, the Outer Space Treaty is the cornerstone, and its universalization and eOective implementation should remain a priority. On the other hand, we believe that some of these norms of responsible behaviour are already contained. You know the voluntary international measures and guidelines, such as the 2013 report of the Group of Governmental Experts on Transparency and Conﬁdence Building Measures in Outer Space Activities and UN Couples 21 Guidelines for the Long-Term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities, and they should be further elaborated. Mr. Chair, I would like to conclude by brieﬂy addressing the main features that we feel can help to gut and guide the work of this group. In identifying norms, rules, and principles of responsible behavior. First, the very notion of responsible behavior constitutes such a principle. It speciﬁes that any human activity in outer space must be conducted in a way that minimizes the risk of degrading the space environment, avoiding, among other things, the unnecessary creation of long-lasting debris, and contributes to the probation of an arms race in outer space. Second, these norms, rules, and principles of responsible behavior should fulﬁll a wide range of functions, such as improving the clarity of intentions of space actors, reducing the risk of misperception and misjudgment, and helping to prevent confrontation. This should also help to share information among space actors to build mutual trust. 3rd Given the dual use character of many space objects, these rules should be all-encompassing in scope, covering all dimensions of space activities applying. To both military and civil operations and based on the principle of non-harmful interference against space objects, I thank you, Mr. Chair. ', 'Chairman: I thank the distinguished Ambassador of Italy for his statement, and now I would like to oOer the ﬂoor to the distinguished representative of the European Union. You have the format.  European Union: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I have the honor to speak on behalf of the European Union and the candidate countries N Macedonia, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the potential candidate country Georgia, align themselves with this statement. We would like to congratulate you and your team for your excellent work in continuing to steer this open-ended working group and we also appreciate your eOorts in preparing the Chair Summary and Elements paper. We look forward to further substantive discussions this week and we would like to assure you of our continued full support and cooperation. The EU and its Member States fully supported the establishment of the open-ended Working Group on reducing Space threats as a pragmatic step in a cooperative and comprehensive process that helps building a common understanding of what can be considered responsible and irresponsible behaviours. The EU and its Member States reiterate that the process must be inclusive and consider a multi stakeholder approach encouraging the attendance of other international organisations. Commercial actors and civil society representatives as vitally important and fully in accordance with established practice. The EU has made several joint contributions and several EU member states have submitted national or cross regional working papers. We welcome the active engagement demonstrated during this process. Which shows the commitment of United Nations, Member States and relevant organizations to address the issue of reducing space threats through norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour. Mr. Chair. Outer space is an area where security challenges have increased in recent years. risking not only the sustainability of the space environment, but also the safe and secure operations of space activities and access to services on which the global community rely and it therefore merits of full attention. The rapid growth of human activity coupled with the increased diversity of space operators. Makes it increasingly necessary to further develop international norms and standards, guidelines, best practices and principles of responsible behaviour and transparency and conﬁdence building measures related to human activity in space. While ensuring compliance with existing international law. International law, in particular the United Nations Charter, the UN Treaties and outer space, and international humanitarian law is applicable to outer space. The Outer Space 3T as well as the guiding principles developed in the UN framework. Constitute the basis of the global governance in outer space, any norm of responsible behavior should be consistent, with and complement Those texts as they constitute the essential framework for the peaceful exploration and use of outer space for the beneﬁt of all nations.  The EU and its Member States are actively engaged in promoting the preservation of a safe, secure and sustainable outer space and the peaceful use of outer space on an equitable and mutually acceptable basis for all, for present and future generations. We are strongly committed to the prevention of an arms race in outer space, which is essential for strengthening International Security and stability and for safeguarding the free exploration and long-term use of the space environment for peaceful purposes. We are of the view that further practical steps can be taken to enable risk reduction. Prevent conﬂict from occurring in outer space and prevent an arms race in ', 'outer space. Such eOorts are important, Given the ambiguity regarding the question of what constitutes a weapon in space. It is essential to build conﬁdence between space actors. To decrease the perception of threats and to avoid any escalation that could lead to catastrophic consequences, including for space operators and civilians. Historically, legally binding instruments in outer space have drawn on previous non legally binding commitments. Through the adoption of diOerent resolutions in the UN framework the EU and its Member States do not exclude the possibility of new legally binding instrument in the future, but belief that given that you will use nature of many space systems. An approach based on behaviours supported by relevant monitoring capabilities is the most pragmatic and immediate way forward to improve space security today. This will help to reduce the risk of misunderstanding, misinterpretation, and miscalculation, and help to decrease the risk of conﬂicts and escalation in outer space. We therefore believe that establishing norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviours in outer space. Is an indispensable step, Moreover, legal regimes governing other domains such as maritime cyberspace, telecommunication. Norms of behavior constitute good examples. and diOerent best practices and lesson learned which could be taken into consideration for the work on responsible behaviours in outer space. This behavioral approach should supplement the relevant traditional disarmament and arms control tools to further strengthen the existing normative framework. We strongly believe that global principle of responsible behavior will contribute to further increase international cooperation in space. Commit to mutual non-interference in the peaceful cooperation, exploration and use of outer space. Facilitate an equitable access to outer space and increase transparency and conﬁdence in the conduct of space activities. Consideration of irresponsible behaviour should take into account the consequences on safety, sustainability and security in outer space. As well as the impacts that they could have for international peace, security and stability Including full space operators and civilians. In this regard, The EU and its Member States fully supported the UNGA resolution 7741 and we welcome the commitment made so far by several UN member states not to conduct destructive direct ascent anti-satellite missile tests. We consider such commitment as a pragmatic, concrete and measurable step forward for strengthening International Security and stability. Mr. Chair, trust and conﬁdence are at the center of any security building process. Thus, we are convinced that fostering mutual trust and strengthening transparency between states is key to enhance space security and to avoid a conﬂict in outer space. The EU and its Member States consider that publishing and sharing information about space doctrines, policies and strategies. Is a responsible behaviour and will help create conﬁdence between diOerent actors. Sharing information on space launch vehicle programs, including pre-launch notiﬁcations. Is already established practice under the Dai Code of Conduct. The EU and its Member States encourage all states to subscribe to the HCOC and to fully implement its provisions. Such measures will help reduce the risk of misperception, miscalculation and unwanted conﬂict escalation. Other types of transparency and conﬁdence building measures, such as those contained in the report of the 2013 GGE on TCBMS, are still relevant and could also serve as a basis for further work. We look forward to discussing them this week. Mr. Chair, as ﬁrm believers in multilateralism, with the United Nations at its core. We strongly believe that now is urgent and in the interest of all states to pragmatically ', \"and immediately improve space security and to act swiftly in order to agree on a global, common and multilateral solution through greater coordination and cooperation. With the involvement of all UN Member States and relevant organisations. In relation to our work in this session, the EU and its Member States see great merit in the development of norms against the deliberate creation of space multiple debris and norms to address in orbit rendezvous operations as well as those that to address activities that impair the provision of space-based services. Critical to the public and severely aOect or even harm civilians. Proximity orbital operation that aOects another state space system. Carry signiﬁcant risks of misunderstandings and should also be further discussed. Against this background, information and communication about the intentions of such operations are essential to avoid misunderstanding and misperceptions. We also think that possible norms could be discussed on operation having an impact. On the security of peoples and goods, we reiterate our commitment to further contribute to the work of the open-ended working group by submitting, after the session and prior to the next session of this working group, A joint EU contribution on the themes that will be discussed during this week and which will include reﬂections on the way ahead. Mr. Chair. In conclusion, the continuation of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine obliges the EU to reiterate its condemnation in the strongest possible terms of this act. We are fully committed to the rule based international order and to the principle of international law, which do not only apply on Earth but also in outer space. The EU expresses full solidarity with Ukraine and the Ukrainian people and remain strongly committed to the ﬁght against impunity for atrocity. Thank you, Mr. Chair.  Chairman: I thank the distinguished representative of the European Union for her statement. And now I would like to oOer the ﬂoor to the distinguished ambassador of India. You have the ﬂoor, ambassador.  India: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We'd like to begin by appreciating your work in guiding the proceedings of this body. My delegation is assuring you of its fullest cooperation. We note with appreciation the papers that we have received from a number of delegations. We are in the process of examining them carefully. India’s views on the OEWG are recorded in the explanation of vote to UNGA Resolution 76/231. India is, however, participating in the proceedings of the group. Substantively and constructively, we are encouraged that this OEWG works on the basis of consensus. India reaOirms the applicability of international law and the UN Charter to activities and the exploration and use of outer space. India is opposed to the weaponization of outer space and has not resorted to any arms race in outer space. We emphasize the importance of the Outer Space Treaty as the cornerstone of space governance. India is also a signatory to other principle UN treaties and outer space, including the Rescue Agreement, the Liability Convention and the Registration Convention. We voluntarily adhere to the 21 Guidelines for Long Term Sustainability of Outer Space Activities, which were multilaterally agreed in UN copios in 2019. In addition, we implement the mitigation guidelines recommended by the Interagency Space Debris Coordination Committee. We voluntarily implement the transparency and conﬁdence building measures in outer space in accordance with the report of the GG in 2013. India \", 'believes that priority should be accorded to developing uniform interpretation and understandings of the provisions of the existing legal treaties relating to outer space common understanding of terms such as due regard.  Harmful interference, peaceful purposes, among others, required to be developed in appropriate platforms, including this. Increased clarity on existing international law will contribute to reducing misperceptions or misinterpretations in outer space. They will also reduce threats in outer space. India reiterates its preference for legally binding instruments in outer space. In our understanding, they elicit a stronger guarantee of compliance and greater commitment by states to adhere to the obligations. We are open, however, to the development of universal and non-discriminatory non-binding norms and TCB miss as they can be complementary to a legally binding instrument. We have a belief that they are not a substitute to legal arrangements. Since non-binding norms need wide acceptance to be eOective, their compliance may be less rigorous and monitoring compliance to these norms continues to remain a major challenge. Mr. Chairman, we acknowledge that there may be some merit in the pursuit of a behavioural approach to outer space security. However, subjectivity in the assessment and interpretation of space behaviors and perception of threats, who makes these assessments, how these assessments are made, and the application of such determinations are a matter of concern to my delegation. We also have concerns about the veriﬁcation of space behaviour using current technology and the access to relevant information and data. We feel that the elaboration of common understandings and criteria that are accepted and understood by all uniformly. Identiﬁcation of areas of agreement and divergent and the means for unbiased assessments and determinations should be further discussed, including in this working group. In this context, my delegation would like to draw your attention to the report of the gig on TCPMS in 2013 para. 34 and 35, which state the criteria for a TCBM. It must be clear, practical and proven, and it must be able to be eOectively conﬁrmed by other parties in its application. Mr. Chairman, we also feel that it is necessary for this body to take into account the substantial body of work and discussions that have taken place on enhancing outer space safety, security and sustainability. My delegation is of the view that the full implementation of existing norms should be given priority over the creation of a new set of norms. We believe that mandates must be respected, overlaps and creation of multiple standards on the same set of issues should be avoided. Mr. Chairman, India is a developing country. The outcomes of any space security related process, including in this OEWG, should not impede the process of scientiﬁc and technological development for peaceful and legitimate purposes and not create new obstacles or restrictions for emerging spacefaring nations or developing nations. They should also not impede existing international cooperation eOorts. Mr. Chairman, we believe that outer space should remain as an ever-expanding frontier of cooperative endeavor rather than conﬂict. We will support international instruments aimed at maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes for all, subject to there being non-discriminatory in nature adhering to equity. That they are adequately veriﬁable and provide greater certainty and predictability in the outer space environment.  ', \"Chairman: Thank you. I thank the distinguished ambassador of India for his statement. And now I would like to give the ﬂoor to the distinguished representative of the Philippines. You have the ﬂoor, Sir.  Philippines:  Mr. Chair, the Philippines aligns itself with a statement delivered yesterday by Indonesia on behalf of ASEAN. We take the ﬂoor, this time in our national capacity. We take this opportunity to think and commend you for preparing under your responsibility the Chairs paper ahead of our session this week. This paper provides A balanced, comprehensive and accurate representation of the contours of the Group's discussions so far. In particular, the paper captures are stocktaking of existing international legal and other normative frameworks concerning threats arising from state behaviors with respect to outer space. The Philippines believe that international law, including the Charter of the United Nations Customary international law and in times of armed conﬂict, international humanitarian law applies to outer space. Our recognition of the application of international humanitarian law should not in any way legitimize the relegation of outer space as a domain for war ﬁghting. The Philippines is currently in the process of ratifying all international treaties pertaining to artist space with practical instruments such as the registration and liability conventions. Being the immediate priority, however, the Philippine Space Act of 2019 already requires us to abide by these treaties as a matter of law and policy, even pending the completion of our domestic ratiﬁcation process. Our commitment to this existing international legal and normative framework is part of our enduring adherence to our rules based international order. We note with interest the statement of Mexico on the need for us to recognize the nuances that diOerentiates Rules, norms, and principles. We also note with interest Friends Working paper, which suggests speciﬁc criteria for a norm to be established, adopted and universalized. We believe that such framing is useful as we proceed with our deliberations in accordance with our mandate. Along with the SAYAN Member States, the Philippines considers the 1967 Outer Space Treaty contain foundational principles of International Space law such as equality among all states, space faring or otherwise than an appropriation of outer space, the applicability of international law in outer space, no placement of weapons of mass destruction, state responsibility and liability, the state registry, the duty of jury guard, and international cooperation. These principles provide the bedrock for the development of north of responsible behavior. The Philippines attaches particular importance on the duty of jury guard. The elaboration of this principle enriches the consideration of responsible behavior in outer space. It is not our intention to reopen Article 9 of the OST. Instead, we merely refer to the rich resource provided by state practice and your students, as well as legislative history behind this principle, which provides useful guidance in clarifying what the legally binding duty of Jury Guard entails. In this regard, consistency of international law demands that application of jury guard in outer space does not deviate signiﬁcantly from its application in the context of ISIS. Article 9 of the OST also provides that if a state has reason to believe that an activity of our experiment planned by its or its national in outer space, including the moon and other celestial body, would cause potential harmful interference with activities of other states. In the peaceful exploration and use of outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, it shall undertake appropriate \", \"international consultations before proceeding with any such activity or experiment. As well, state consultations before proceeding with any such activity experiment as well state which has reason to believe that an activity or experiment planned by another state party in outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, would cause potentially harmful interference with activities in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space. Including the moon and other celestial bodies may request consultation concerning the activity or experiment. We agree with the Republic of Korea on the need to give this legal obligation concrete expression, and we welcome Japan's suggestion in its working paper to establish a system of national contact points to facilitate such consultations. Finally, we continue to encourage all states to join The Hague Code of Conduct on Ballistic Missiles Proliferation. Thank you, Mr. Chair.  Chairman: I thank the distinguished representative of the Philippines for his statement. Continuation Tango Eleanor, delighted to give the ﬂoor to the distinguished representative of Chile, you have the ﬂoor.  Chile: Gracias Senior, Brazil. Thank you, Chairman. Chile would like to pay tribute to the work undertaken in the Court of the Session and reiterate our willingness to provide support and cooperation to contribute to a successful outcome in the task given to US Chair. Recent decades have been marked by an extremely rapid and constant development of activity in space, together with developed in science research and IT developments. Space has become important to virtually all areas of human endeavour with a welter of economic and other beneﬁts for nations. From its very outset in terms of space activities, Space Chile has been interested in space initiatives and cooperating with them, acknowledging the major progress has been achieved through international cooperation in scientiﬁc and technological endeavours. Our country is a party to all the UN Space Treaties, including the Treaty on Principles Governing the Behaviour of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and other Celestial bodies.  As such, Chile adheres to principles promoting the exclusively peaceful use of outer space. Moreover, it is actively involved in multilateral fora.  For example, seeking to prevent Paris and the Coppola committee.  Chile is committed to increasing conﬁdence and trust amongst states through dialogue and transparency, to enable space activities to take place in line with international law norms and rules and as such, it is our view that international law, including the UN Charter, international humanitarian law should apply to outer space. Space aOairs are of relevance to Chile's foreign policy, with a balancing of security and technology concerns, as we endeavour to promote fair, sustainable and responsible use of space. Notwithstanding A foregoing, we are aware of the challenges faced by the international system. With space potentially dangerous in view of the existence of a series of artiﬁcial and natural hazards. Which have been debated at previous sessions of its open-ended working group. Mr. Chairman, it is important to pursue work to improve and develop binding and non-binding legal structures to promote security and stability in outer space. This includes the valuable work being undertaken by this group. To ensure that existing threats, as well as possible threats be addressed as we work towards developing new \", 'norms, rules and principles, with a view ultimately to protecting security and stability in outer space, I thank you.  Chairman: I thank the distinguished representative of Chile for her statement. So, after the ﬂoor to the distinguished representative of Iran, you have the ﬂoor.  Iran: Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman, at the outset of discussion on topic one, we welcome you back to the Chair of this OEWG and wish you all the success in your endeavour to take us to a consensual result. We also thank the secretariat for preparation of this OWG session. Mr. Chairman, suOice to repeat that more than four decades after the after the Conference on Disarmament was mandated to negotiate a legal binding instrument for preventing an arm race in outer space, the goal is still remain as elusive as before and international community is yet faces security challenges and threats that are originating from over increasing weaponization and militarization of outer space. More states are involved in space activities and some private actors are also involved in space launch activities and space application. Mr. Chairman, the rapid growing trend of development of space technologies, the incremental rising of conﬂicts in outer space and the activities of some governments to dominate and seek superiority over the space has revealed the inadequacy of existing international legal instruments in the face of new challenges to maintain the security of outer space and promote. Its peaceful use and exploration. The Islamic Republic of Iran reiterates its well-known position that outer space is the common province of all humankind and the use and exploration of which must be for the beneﬁt of all nations and should remain the domain of peace and international cooperation for peaceful purposes in this connection. We reemphasize the principles envisage in space law as universal. Equal access to outer space for all countries without discrimination, regardless of the level of scientiﬁc, technical and economic development. The non-appropriation of outer space including the moon and other celestial bodies by claim of sovereignty, by use, occupation or any other means. Responsibility of states for their national space activities carried out by both governmental and non-governmental entities. The non-militarisation of outer space use of outer space as a common heritage of humankind for peaceful purposes and international cooperation. The development of space activities, in particular those referred to in the declaration of international cooperation, in the exploration and use of outer space for beneﬁt and in the interest of all states, taking into account the needs of developing countries. Of course, Mr. Chairman, the ﬁve court treaties of space law and the core principles of peaceful use of outer space are adequate enough to guarantee peaceful use of peaceful use and explanation of space if they are completed by prevention of an armed race in outer space. Therefore, it is more compelling today than before that the prevention of an armed race in outer space, known as Paris remain as priority security agenda for international community.  To negotiate a legal binding instrument.  In the Conference on Disarmament and not let this long-awaited mandate of the city to be converted to a fundamentally political agenda.  Intending to subject this high valuable agenda of the city.  To distinction between responsible and irresponsible behaviour of states in outer space, the impact of the departure and deviation from the long lasting mandate of the city and Paris to negotiate illegal binding instrument ', 'for the full EOective and non-discriminatory prevention of an arm race in outer space as complementary to a space law is ultimately dangerous and politically divisive. This is why we are insisting on the argument in the OEWG that we are not convinced that the concept of responsible behaviour, because it is subjective, vague and extracted from social science literature to deﬁne norm settings as a standard of appropriate behaviour for political act that comply with it. Instead of legal undertaking, is solution for challenging issues of Paris derive from political agenda. Because norms are usually being set based on expectation instead of law. They are easier to be adapted to a political situation or situation of a particular state or states, who are adamantly, adamantly against the pursuit of legal agreements to keep their ﬂexibility, for example, in the case of outer space, to follow their national superiority in outer space. The outer space is not the sole case in this regard, particularly Principally, characterization of behaviors through norms instead of legal agreements. Inherently and as past experience has shown, will become a tool for some countries to evade their own responsibility and put the blame on others. As we said it before create, it creates ideological bias, double standard political division, technical barriers. An abusive unilateral restrictions and coercive measures as pretext to hamper the peaceful use of. Outer space. We are of the ﬁrm view that the OEWG should create condition for the negotiation of a legal binding instrument and outer space so as to prevent an arm race in outer space by identifying the root causes of threats to peaceful use of outer space. Mr. Chairman, along with Group G21 on the Conference on Disarmament and the Nonalignment movement, we have supported draft treaty on Paris known as PPWT, presented by two delegations as a basis for establishment of an ad hoc committee to negotiate a legal binding in the city. We have also actively participated in the United Nation Group of Governmental expert established in 2017 and its meeting held in 2018 and 2019. The GG conducted an in-depth and substantive discussion on elements of relevant international legal binding instrument to prevent an arm race in outer space. Unfortunately, a certain state has stood against consensus in the GGE and not let the report of the group follow suit in the UN. Such a state, while unwilling to subject the development of its military capabilities in outer space to any legal undertaking, has also rejected the negotiation of a legal binding treaty for Paris and has stalled single handedly against any movement in the UN disarmed machinery in this regard. Furthermore, some states, under the guise of collective defence, have deﬁned the space as an area of military operation and have increased military investment for space and overtly and poverty are developing a space with a warfare system and military alliance at the highest speed. The creation of a space force and the formation of military alliance to prepare for military action in a space and are clear manifestation of growing dangers and threats of the armed race in outer space. In recent years, a certain state as being the ﬁrst country to test anti-satellite weapons and creating more space debris than any other countries has increased its plan and actions to achieve military and strategic superiority to gain control of space. In a hypocritical and misleading movie, it talks about banning the testing of anti-satellite missile which is accompanied by the support of Our allies. Furthermore, with the integration of commercial military space system security legal challenges are expanding as a as a result, hostile action against other countries is growing. As an example, Mr. Chairman, we should refer to the illegal operation of the broadband satellite Internet service known as Starlink, within ', \"the territory of the Islamic Republic of Iran by a mega constellation operator known as Space E, with the US Government support. Starlink receivers have been began begun to be smuggled into Iran in hope of providing a back oO Internet. Based on the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of State in Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including Moon and Other Celestial Bodies in Visas in its Article 6, State parties to the Treaty shall bear international responsibility for national activities in outer space, including Moon and other celestial bodies, whether such activities are carried on by governmental agency or by non-governmental entities, and for assuring that national activities are carried out in conformity with the provisions set forth in the present Treaty Of non-governmental entities in outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies should require. Authorization and continuing supervision by the appropriate state to the Treaty in spite of our Government's formal objection. Address to UNOSA, ITU, United Nations Security Council via formal, verbal or not as well as Federal Commission, Federal Communication Commission If double C and Constellation Company which provides satellite Internet no response receive. The regulation governing landing rights, regarding rights regarding the provisions of satellite. In the Islamic Republic of Iran is also formally submitted to U.S. government if they will see and space each corporation in a verbal note on 25th October 2020 through the Embassy of Switzerland in Tehran, serving as protecting power of the USA in Iran, furthermore. Regulate regulation governing landing rights regarding provisions of satellite services in the Islamic Republic of Iran available on the website of the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology, ICT and operators were formally informed of any communication satellite constellation provides broadband Internet must respect local local landing right. As countries have sovereignty claims over spectrum allocation related to broadcast in their territory, such irresponsible illegal act is not only considered as intervening. Internal aOairs of Iran, in accordance with Article 2, paragraph seven of the United Nations Charter, which has to be observed by all member states, but also is ﬂagrant violation of the international law, in particular the inviolability of the sovereign equality of all UN members in accordance to the UN Charter. Consequently, the Islamic Republic of Iran holds the US Government responsible for such unlawful and irresponsible operation. While its SpaceX corporation as private company, it is not secret that Starling is not merely A civilian project and has military objective as an element for militarisation and invigoration of an arm race in outer space to threat national security of states. Therefore, the Islamic Republic of Iran reserve its inherent right to respond in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations to any threat posed or wrongful act against its national sovereignty and its territorial integrity. The conduct and action of constellation companies in Iran's territory without authorization is a blatant breach of sovereignty, which include refrain from complying with the OST 1967 as well as Iran's landing rights. Mr. Chair, yesterday the point was made regarding launching a remote sensing satellite by Iran. It should be noted that Iran's indigenous advancement and progress in the ﬁeld of space capabilities Have been building upon on our previous assets and capacities, planning for sustainable utilization of space and getting from getting from space to accomplish on the ground welfare. So launching a remote sensing satellite into low Earth orbit is an instant in this regard. This achievement has been obtained while illegal unilateral sanctions were imposed on our space agencies to seek the cooperation with others, with other states to \", \"launch satellites.  For our countries, as Iran is prone to natural disasters as it needs formidable remote sensing to prevent and manage such natural disasters. The illegitimate action in imposing sanctions against our space agencies is in clear contradiction with the with the principle of International Space law. Such as free access to outer space and international cooperation in space activities.  It should be reminded that this illegitimate action will not prevent Iran's eOorts to develop its peaceful space programme while using indigenous capacities and taking advantage of international cooperation. I thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Chairman: I thank the distinguished representative of Iran for his statement and now I would like to give the photo to the distinguished representative of New Zealand. Do you have the ﬂoor, Sir?  New Zealand: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Tenatata, Tataa, Katoa, We're greetings in Mouldy, New Zealand's indigenous language. I begin by thanking you for your eOorts in facilitating these discussions, especially given the unconstructive procedural challenges that you had to help the OEWG to navigate. I would also like to thank the Secretariat and the translators for their work in supporting this meeting. Mr. Chair, altered our New Zealand is strongly committed to ensuring a peaceful, safe, stable, secure and sustainable space environment. We strongly support eOorts to prevent an arms race developing in space. We're encouraged by the wide participation in this OEWG process, which underlines the importance that states place on reducing space threats. This collaboration reﬂects the spirit of Mahitahi working together, which typiﬁes how scientists, businesses and governments cooperate internationally across the broadest range of space activities. Discussions here have highlighted many points of broad agreement. States have recognized the primacy of the existing legal frameworks which underpins space activities, whilst acknowledging that these frameworks are not by themselves suOicient for managing all aspects of space security into the future. There has also been wide agreement on the irresponsibility of activities which contribute to the growing problem of orbital debris. As such, New Zealand was pleased to see the adoption by the UN General Assembly of Resolution 7741, which calls upon all States to commit not to conduct tests of destructive direct descent anti-satellite missiles. We are further encouraged by the growing number of states that have now made this commitment, which is an important measure to prevent damage to the space environment and, also supports the prevention of an arms race in space. We call upon all states that have yet to make this commitment to do so discussions to date have underscored the diOiculty in any approach that would prohibit particular technologies. Many space technologies are dual use and could constitute a threat if used improperly. While the use of these capabilities for peaceful purposes should not be prohibited, their use in certain circumstances or in particular ways could be perceived by other space actors as threatening, destabilising or irresponsible.  Elsa Rowan New Zealand therefore reiterates our support for elaborating responsible behavior in space by developing shared principles, rules and norms. This is a promising pathway forward to address space threats, which does not limit the development of new capabilities that could deliver widespread beneﬁt such as active debris removal or on orbit surfacing. We do not \", \"rule out the negotiation of a legally binding instrument in the future. We see this as an iterative process. Our work here, developing norms, rules and procedures could help to inform any future negotiation of a legally binding instrument. Mr. Chair, as an initial contribution, we suggest 5 principles that will help to reduce space threats. Firstly, outer space activities should be conducted in accordance with, and must be examined under, international law, including the UN Charter, Space Treaties and the law of space responsibility, as well as a range of legal regimes such as international humanitarian law. Behaviour contrary to international law cannot be responsible. Given the focus of discussions during this session, particularly yesterday, I would like to thank the ICRC in this context for their useful research into the applicability of international humanitarian law to the Space Act to space activities. Secondly, although adherence to existing IS, national law must be foundational in considering responsible behaviour, we must also recognise that the existing legal frameworks were developed decades ago and do not account for subsequent rapid growth in space activity or development in space technology. So, space actors must cooperate to develop and implement new frameworks of behaviour to ensure the security and sustainability of space in the 21st century. Put simply, some behaviour may not be responsible even where it is permissible under international law. Thirdly, Transparency and communication provide a strong basis for minimizing the perception of threat and supporting a stable space environment. Enhanced communication will help to build trust among space actors and to reduce the risks of misperception, misunderstanding, and escalation. Fourthly, the deliberate creation of orbital debris is irresponsible and introduces additional needless risk to space infrastructure. States should not intentionally or knowingly support the creation of debris and this consequence should be considered in depth when undertaking any space activity. Finally, states should not conduct or support space activity that would intentionally damage critical infrastructure. Such activity could threaten wide access to vital services, is destabilizing and is irresponsible. Mr. Chair, we welcome the opportunity to discuss views on possible principles, as well as the more detailed norms and rules which will help to operationalize them. We look forward to working together to develop a framework of responsible behaviour which will safeguard the peaceful and sustainable use of outer space now and into the future. Thank you.  Chairman: I thank the distinguished representative of New Zealand for his statement. And now I'd like to give the ﬂoor to the distinguished representative of Japan. You have the ﬂoor, Sir.  Japan: Thank you, Mr. Chair. We would like to share Japan's idea related to topic one brieﬂy. Regarding the discussion of ***** laws and principal responsible behavior, Japan recognizes that compliance with existing international law is important. So Japanese are both the notion of discussing whether international law can be applied to outer space. From this point of view, Japan directly proposed foreign direct recommendation. This is also included in Japan's working paper. States should respect or aOirm their compliance with international law, including Outer Space Treaty, the United States Charter and international humanitarian Law in outer space. I thank you, Mr. Chair.  \", \"Chairman: I thank the distinguished representative of Japan for his statement. And now I would like to give the ﬂoor to the distinguished representative of Norway. You have the ﬂoor, Sir.  Norway: Chair, thank you again for your excellent stewardship of our working group, and thank you also to all those here who've provided us with very helpful working papers for this session. In this third session, we move beyond taking stock of existing normative frameworks and beyond the consideration about activities that may be perceived irresponsible or threatening. We have reached the crux of our mandate as we now start formulating recommendations on possible norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviours that can promote security in space and avoid instability relating to threats.  To Space Systems, we have a rich list of themes in the indicative timetable to frame our discussions. If we are to prevent an arms race in outer space and preserve space as a peaceful, safe, stable and sustainable environment, it is important that we address the reduction of space threats in a broad manner. Even in the absence of weapons in space, as that term is traditionally understood, there will still be potential for misunderstandings, miscalculations, escalation, and potentially conﬂict in or stemming from space. Resolution 76231 invites us to take such a broad perspective on the issue of threats to and from space systems. In our view, developing norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour will move us in this direction and is likely to lay the best foundation for convergence on possible future regulation. Some seem doubtful about the usefulness of developing norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour as a means to promote security and prevent conﬂict in space. Our experience is that voluntary norms indeed do complement international legal regulations. As the 2015 report of the DG on Cyberspace succinctly put it, voluntary, non-binding norms of responsible state behaviour can reduce risks to international peace, security and stability. Accordingly, norms do not seek to limit or prohibit action that is otherwise consistent with international law. Norms reﬂect the expectations of the international community, set standards for responsible state behaviour and allow the international community to assess the activities and intentions of states. End of quotation. The rich history of work on TCBMS in relation to space tends to underscore this point. On the topic of international law, allows repeats and basic aOirmations, space is not an illegal vacuum. Of course. The Outer Space Treaty, the Registration Convention, the Rescue Agreement and the Liability Convention provide an important legal bedrock. But the legal foundation goes far beyond those treaties. As reﬂected in Article Three of the Air Space Treaty, international law, including the UN Charter, applies to the conduct of states in outer space. So international law regulates the conduct of states, whether on Earth, in space, or in any other domain. And most fundamentally, this includes the obligation of states to refrain from the threat or use of force against another state in the event of an armed conﬂict related to outer space. Article Three of the Outer Space Treaty reminds us that international humanitarian law also applies in space and we too would like to thank the ICSE for its very useful research into the issue of application of IGEL in space. Mr. Chair, norms, rules and principles responsible behaviour should be complemented by a relevant transparency and conﬁdence building measures. Depending on the outcomes of our discussions, we should review the applicability of existing TCBMS in order to facilitate \", 'compliance and monitoring, and we should also consider the establishment of new TCBMS or the modiﬁcation of existing ones.  Finally, Mr. Chair, we wish to thank you again for the helpful set of guiding topics in the timetable and much look forward to participating this week in the development of norms, rules and principles for Responsible behavior in space. Thank you.  Chairman: I thank the distinguished representative of Norway for his statement. This was the last. Oh yes, we have another request for the ﬂoor from a Member State. Distinguished representative of Germany has the ﬂoor.  Germany: Thank you, Mr. Chair, for giving me the ﬂoor. Germany fully aligns with the statement that has been delivered by the European Union. On the speciﬁc issue of Topic 1 Normals and principles derived from existing international legal and other normative frameworks, I would like to make some additional marks in remarks in our national capacity. As we put in our paper, principles, norms and roots of responsible behaviours are distinct from and without prejudice to binding norms of international law, and it seems to me, as to many other delegates, that at least on this point, there was much agreement. By the delegation which took the ﬂoor so far existing conventions and regimes and among them ﬁrst and foremost the forest-based court treaties Should be exceeded to them should be ratiﬁed and they should be adhered to by all UN Member States, and the implementation of these treaties should be conducted eOectively and in good faith. In our view, there is not much reason to believe that legally binding international law should or could even be substituted by voluntarily politically binding principles, norms and roots of responsible behaviors. Contrary, we fully recognize the primacy of the legally binding normative framework over non legally binding principles of responsible behaviors. Any such principle should be consistent with the existing normative framework. But as it was stated also by many delegates today and yesterday, principal norms and rules can make a useful contribution for developing international norms by informing state practices on the application of existing space law. Again, a quote from our paper.  In our paper we identiﬁed 7 areas for principles, Norms of Responsible Behaviours where we will elaborate on in the speciﬁc topics. I just want also to mention the TCBMS that were identiﬁed, discussed and proposed by consensus by the GG and Transparency and conﬁdence building Measures in outer space in 2013. Most of these measures are still awaiting being implemented. My ﬁnal point, we believe that international humanitarian law is applicable in times of armed conﬂict in outer space, and there, it seems, was not agreement on this point. Today the view was expressed that this aOirmation would automatically entail the risk of a military conﬂict but as many delegations have stated, the applicable applicability of international human law does not legitimise the use of force of the threat of force in outer space, as this is forbidden by Article 2 Power Four of the UN Charter. In contrast, international humanitarian law minimizes negative eOects of armed conﬂicts, be it in the domains of land, Sea, air, cyber or outer space? Thank you for giving me the ﬂoor again.  ', \"Chairman: I thank the distinguished representative of Germany for his statement, and we have another request from 1 delegation. The distinguished representative of Algeria has the ﬂoor.  Algeria: Thank you, Chair. My delegation would like to take this opportunity to address our sincere and warm gratitude for the eOort you have made to prepare this third session substantive session of the OEWG on reducing space threats through norms. Rules and Principles of Responsible Behaviors. You can count on the full support of our delegation in the implementation of your work chair.  We are currently discussing the implementation of resolution 76 to 31and we're at an important moment in our work regarding the challenges facing International Security. The statements we've heard recently, just as the rich documentations that we have seen here represent a signiﬁcant contribution to the consolidation of our work need legal. Existing legal framework as well related to threats of state behavior in the in outer space, including the UN Charter and the Outer Space Treaty as well, amongst these documents we've been discussing. Legal norms and measures to take in order to lead to the appropriate conclusions of the work of our work, the reaOirmation of the validity of the legal framework and current regulations and identifying any gaps or issues, Including Current bodies that are competent in this area. We've also heard about possible forms of behavior in order to maintain space security and safety, speciﬁcally respecting the regulatory and legal framework that currently exists and appropriate behavior and strengthening these systems. This has LED us to the question of preventing an arms race in outer space, which is reﬂected in Para 41 of the outcome document of the 10th Extraordinary Session of the General Assembly dedicated to disarmament and in accordance with which new measures should be taken, as well as international negotiations, in conformity with the spirit of the Treaty on the principle regulating the activities of States and exploration and use of outer space. Chair Algeria shares the concerns regarding the increasing threat of an arms race in outer space and threats to peace and security in the world. Prevention of such an arms race is an imperative all states must adhere to their responsibilities and refrain from Committing any from taking on any activities that would compromise this peace and security, as well as the, for example, the placement of any forms of weapons in outer space. The increasing use of outer space requires transparency and better TBMS, as well as other measures to enhance the responsibility of our actions and the peaceful use of outer space and preventing an arms race in outer space. We must refrain from any actions that are incompatible with these goals or compromise the principles of international humanitarian law. Outer space celestial bodies are the common heritage of humanity. We must be able to explore them and use them in a spirit of cooperation with the beneﬁt of all of humanity and all countries. Regardless of their level of economic or scientiﬁc development, we must work to provide full access to technology related to outer space through cooperation, technical assistance and capacity building for developing countries. Algeria reaOirms its support for the strengthening of the legal framework around outer space and a collective spirit to build a better future for humanity. Algeria reaOirms that the CD, the only multilateral negotiation platform for disarmament, has a primary role to play in this area and must engage in negotiations on an international binding on Paris. My country reaOirms its commitment to \", \"preventing an arms race, which is reﬂected in its position at the CD as well as through its vote in favor of variety of decisions adopted by the UNGA. Chair, we recognize the importance of preventing an arms race in outer space, and my delegation is prepared to contribute to the implementation of this goal and will spare no eOort. Thank you.  Chairman: I thank the distinguished representative of Algeria for his statement. And now the next speaker will be the distinguished ambassador of the Netherlands. You have the ﬂoor, ambassador. The distinguished representative of the Netherlands.  Netherlands: Let me take this opportunity to thank you again for your excellent guidance of this working group, my delegation. Due to sound interference from the microphone, this statement will not be interpreted and wishes to assure you of our support to the work of this working group.  Sorry, sorry to interrupt. Could you please use the other microphone because it doesn't seem to be working. There's an interference, harmful interference. Does it? Does it work now?  No, no, the sound is inappropriate for interpretation, better OK. Let me start. Again, thank you for giving me the ﬂoor and let me take this opportunity to thank you again for your excellent guidance. My delegation wishes to make some additional comments on today's topic and wishes to assure you of our support to the work of this working group. Mr. Chair, today my delegation wishes to stress the importance of international law. International law is essential to the Kingdom of the Netherlands. In fact, written in our Constitution is an express obligation for the Kingdom's government to promote the development of the international rule of law. We thus attached great importance to the strengthening of existing rules and the development of norms and principles that may guide our behaviour in outer space. The development of Internet of the international rule of law may be achieved through many mechanisms. Conventions and treaties are one of them, and the ﬁve UN treaties in outer space are an important example of this. However, also the development of soft law guidelines, TCBMS and the sharing of best practices may be important from the development of the rule of law to this may be added to dissemination of the understanding of International Space law such as through education and the publication of manuals like the Woomera Manual. Mr. Chair, let me mark ﬁve issues that are important to us. First, there can be no doubt about the applicability of international law in outer space. This follows from Article Three of the OST, and, in that regard, we wish to stress that, in view of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, this includes international humanitarian law, but also the law and state responsibility. Obviously the ﬁve UN space treaties constitute lex specialis and to the extent that this warrants that this is warranted by the application of the rules and hierarchy of norms.  They may proceed over more general rules of international law, but space law does not operate in a vacuum. Second, the development of soft law does not prevent the ultimate development of hard law. In other areas, such as in international environmental law, soft law norms eventually crystallized into conventions. The fact that we may desire ultimately to achieve hard law should not keep us from agreeing on soft law as an instrument to guide our behavior in outer space. Our cause is not a drafting of conventions. Our cause is the safe, secure and sustainable outer space. 3rd Space Law already contains principles that guide us to name a few. The OST obliges states to practice due regard, to avoid harmful interference and to \", \"inform the Secretary General of the UN, as well as the public and the international scientiﬁc community of their activities in outer space. Our task is not to change those principles, but to determine, in view of the rapid development of space technology, how to apply them and this is where behavior becomes essential. And whereas space activity may be responsible or irresponsible, not because of its capacity, but because of the behavior and the intention of the operator state behind the activity. 4th And in view of the previous point, we would support specifying what it means to have due regard, what it means to avoid harmful interference, etcetera. And in that regard, we would note that both the United Kingdom and the United States have made helpful suggestions as to what this could look like in their written submission, to which may be added the suggestions made in oral interventions during the sessions by many others. Is constitute a solid basis for our discussions. 5th and ﬁnally, the Kingdom of the Netherlands would speciﬁcally refer to the commitment not to conduct a structure of direct descent asset tests as an excellent example of the development of a norm that contributes to the reductions of threats in outer space and the promotion of its responsible use. Thank you, Mr. Chair, for your attention.  Chairman: I thank the distinguished representative of the Netherlands for her statement. And now I would like to oOer the photo to the distinguished representative of China. You have the ﬂoor, Sir.  China: Thank you, Thank you, Mr. Chair.  Yesterday, China has already delivered a statement. Thank you very much for giving me the ﬂoor again. I've listened carefully to the statements of my colleagues and would like to make some short comments. First of all, we are all interested in the relationship between soft law and hard law. Some colleagues might have some misunderstanding and believe that supporters of the hard law will not like soft law. In fact, for example, if we take China as an example, China believes that they are complementary. At the UNGA, China also voted in favor of TCBM, the draft TCBM. The resolution of TCBM China believes that soft law as TCBM is a very useful complement of hard law. However, Softer law cannot replace hard law, Because only legally binding instruments can fully address the issues encountered in the outer space.  In reality, At the CD, we have still not started the negotiation on an instrument on Paris. Regarding the report of the GG on Paris, it has failed as well. Therefore, you can see very clearly that which are the countries that have adopted discriminatory approach Into China actually supports both processes. What China rejects Is those people who reject soft law and that China What China rejects is those people who would want to negotiate to conclude the soft law and Stand in the way of A negotiation of an international instrument. This is the ﬁrst point. I've listened very carefully to the statements made by Germany. There's an increasing number of countries who are aware of the importance of the international instrument. I very much appreciate of the statements made by the German delegation on the international law.  Second, I would like to mention ihr. IHL and the Law on armed conﬂict? Many colleagues believe that HL should apply to outer space China has a diOerent view in this regard IHL should apply to the legal issues Involved in conﬂict situations Armed conﬂict situations even. Well, We are discussing how to prevent arms racing outer space or weaponization in outer space?  All armed conﬂicts, even in outer space This is the very \", \"intention and objective of this meeting. If we discuss IHL here, it equates to discussing the rules of armed conﬂicts. This is not in line with the purposes of this meeting and also will send a wrong message from my understanding, the discussion on cyberspace has also has the same problem.  Many countries believe that IHL does not apply to outer space. Armed, sorry, armed conﬂict law does not apply to outer space. Because this will send a wrong Impression. Which is the cyberspace will be turned into a battleﬁeld. The same goes for outer space, Therefore, regarding the armed conﬂict law and its applicability to outer space, I would like to express a diOerent view. Thank you, Mr. President.  Chairman: I thank the distinguished representative of China for his statement. I was planning to wrap up the speaker's list this morning, but it's not possible as we have additional requests for the ﬂoor. So, I really apologize for other delegations that are requested before. Unfortunately, they're going to have to be the ﬁrst speakers in the afternoon and after that, this afternoon we will begin our discussion on topic to be non-rules and principles relating to a counter space capability including space to earth and space to space threats. In this regard, please note that the secretariat has circulated corrected indicative timetable. There were some typos in in in the 1st paper that was circulated. I apologize for that. So, before we begin our formal discussions this afternoon, we will also suspend the meeting so that we can hear a brieﬁng from the High Representative for Disarmament AOairs on the follow up to the report of the Secretary General entitled Our Common Agenda including on how it relates to our work. So, the ﬁrst thing will be we will give the ﬂoor to the Member States that are still on the speakers list and we have one delegation that have has requested to exercise the right of reply the distinguished delegation of the Russian Federation and so we have to adjourn now and No. So, before we adjourn, we will, we will give the ﬂoor to the delegation that has requested the right of reply. But we will continue with the speakers list. This afternoon I give the vote to the distinguished representation of the Russian Federation. You have the ﬂoor Shiba.  Shiba: Thank you, distinguished Chair. We are obligated to exercise our right of reply in order to react to a number of false insinuations that were made by a number of delegations were speciﬁcally referring to the delegations of the United States of America, the delegation of the European Union. In the context of the Russian Federation special military operation in Ukraine, a number of statements were made related to this operation. First of all, we would like to reject the attempt made by the delegation of the US to refer to certain contradictions in the positions of the Russian Federation, speciﬁcally contradictory approaches to the use of an exclusively civilian infrastructure located under the jurisdiction of the United States, using that in order to further exacerbate the Ukrainian crisis. There is no contradiction here. Regardless of how the US delegation is attempting to portray the situation, the logic is clear. We must implement, adhere to legally binding norms that would enable us to prevent those actions taken by the United States of America to use civilian satellites to further exacerbate the crisis in Ukraine. If there were such legally binding norms. Then there would be no issues related to using civilian satellites for military purposes and the consideration of such civilian satellites or civilian infrastructure as legitimate military targets. Everything is very simple, but for some reason the US \", \"delegation. Now for many decades have consistently rejected legally binding norms on the prohibition of using force or threat of force relating to outer space objects. This has not happened because the United States of America.  Regularly block any negotiations on developing legally binding norms that would prohibit the use of force or threat of force against Space objects. Regarding the false insinuations from the delegation of the European Union, then they do not withstand any sort of criticism. They have attempted the European Union countries and delegation of the EU are attempting to portray themselves as doves of peace that are attempting to put an end to the crisis in Ukraine. But this is not consistent with the real situation on the ground. This is entirely baseless and ungrounded. It's not connected to any sort of actions taken by the European countries or Which? Quite the opposite conﬁrmed that they are not interested in resolving this conﬂict. In fact, they want to continue and exacerbate the conﬂict. This is conﬁrmed by the consistent provision pumping up of weapons into Ukraine and the Kiev regime. This has continued for over 8 years. This is also conﬁrmed by the recognition by Madam Merkel and Mr. Holland of The True. Reasons for the Minsk Agreements of 2015, where there was a direct statement made about what these agreements were made for the Minsk agreement and that there, they indeed have nothing in common with attempts to resolve the situation and crisis in Ukraine. This is also conﬁrmed by the repudiation of any attempt by the Russian Federation to any proposals by the Russian Federation that were made related to guarantees of security in the region. Speciﬁcally, here we are referring to the recent proposals made in December 2022. So, what resolution of this conﬂict could we even be talking about here when these countries are taking actions that are serving the opposite goals that are leading as we have seen. That are knowingly on their part, leading to the opposite eOect to a worsening of the conﬂict. We hope that such statements made by these states will not lead to any confusion amongst the states here. We're all experienced professionals both politically speaking, diplomatically speaking and that is why distinguished delegations. We would like once again to reiterate that such statements are completely unfounded in reality. Regarding the special military operation, the Russian Federation has consistently been acting towards the achievement of the goal it set. For the operation and we assure you that these goals are being implemented and they will be achieved. We thank you. 103.60: I thank the distinguished representative of the Russian Federation. We have one request from 1 delegation. The distinguished delegation of the United States has requested to react to this last intervention. We have until 110 interpretations. So, if you can keep it short this time, Eric, or otherwise, we would do it this afternoon. So please proceed. 103.87: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and apologies for keeping everybody here when we all would prefer to be having lunch. And thank you to the interpreters also for hanging around. Just to be very brief, I appreciate our Russian colleague’s explanation of the challenges that civil and commercial activities present to all of us. And one of the themes we've heard throughout this conversation here is the need for these rules, whether binding or non-binding to apply to all countries. And so, I would ask our Russian colleagues when they go and seek commercial satellite imagery from foreign countries. Do the same rules apply because it is known to the United States? That Russian entities have purchased imagery from Chinese companies that they have used in their conﬂict in Ukraine. So, I hope, as our \", 'Russian colleagues accuse the United States of these issues, that we all consider that all countries are doing this and therefore we should take into account that. Thank you.  Chairman: I thank the distinguished representative of the United States. We have to stop here and we will continue with the list of speakers to exhaust this discussion this afternoon topic and so we will adjourn now and enjoy your lunch. ']\n"

Regarding general principles of international law, the recommendation of the OA Double G should be oriented by the'), Document(page_content='obligations established by the UN Charter, notably.

In this sense, the working paper tabled by the International Committee of the Red Cross oOers valid and useful considerations on the subject and could inform our recommendations in this area.

These include the Principles on the Exploration and'), Document(page_content='Use of Outer Space for the Beneﬁts and, in the interests of all countries, the legal obligation not to place nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction in orbit.

The OWG should also take into account the obligation set forth by Derivative, Derivative, and Supplementary Treaties on outer Space, such as those established by the 1968 Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts, the 1972 Liability Convention and the 1976 Convention on the Registration of Space Objects. The same applies to non-binding guidelines adopted in the context of the Committee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, in particular the Space Debris mitigation guidelines and'), Document(page_content='the long term sustainability guidelines. Furthermore, Brazil also believes that the OWG could beneﬁt from analogies with other branches of international law dedicated to the regulation of common goods, such as the law of the sea and international environmental law.

In conclusion, Mr. Chair, Brazil believes that the OWG should seek to reaOirm the validity of these principles and to recommend norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviour that contribute to the compliance with this body of law and to reinforce its positive impact on safety and security of outer space. In so doing, the OE Double G will hopefully lay a solid groundwork for a future binding instrument on Paris. Thank you, Mr. Chair.

As you know, we seek to make recommendations on possible non-binding norms, rules and principles of responsible behaviours relating to threats by states to space systems, as we identiﬁed in the last session, irresponsible behaviors can increase the risk of miscalculation and misperception. Agreement on these concerns, the threats and irresponsible behaviors, is foundational to our work.

In some cases, it may be better to cease certain behaviors to ensure ongoing peace and security.

Our task for this session is to clarify non-binding norms, rules and principles\"), Document(page_content=\"of responsible behaviour which can address the threats and irresponsible behaviors which we collectively identiﬁed in the last session. A successful example of this approach is the US-led commitment not to conduct destructive direct dissent anti-satellite missile tests.

This is the value of the responsible behaviours approach, and we hope for similar progress to be made throughout this session. Chair Turning now to the topic at hand, Australia wishes to re endorse and reaOirm the abundance of extant legal frameworks. Australia is a signatory to all 5 space treaties including the Outer Space Treaty. We encourage all space varying nations to sign and comply with these treaties. In the context of this open-ended working'), Document(page_content='group, Australia wishes to particularly reaOirm the following key obligations of those treaties.

We also acknowledge the gaps which time and advancing technology have created in these frameworks. The last session of the open-ended working group demonstrated there are behaviours that are not prohibited by existing legal framework but they do raise tensions and lead to possible miscalculation.

Such non-binding approaches can complement international law by allowing the international community to set expectations regarding the conduct of certain space activities. Which, even if lawful, may pose a risk of misunderstanding, escalation, or conﬂict. Chair, Pursuant to addressing these gaps in previous sessions, we have discussed drawing insight from other frameworks in Australia's 2021 submission to the Secretary General's report on Resolution 7536 on reducing space threats. Through norms,\"), Document(page_content=\"rules and principles of responsible behaviours, we propose that we establish clear communication and information exchange protocols for when satellites are operating near to each other.

In fact, written in our Constitution is an express obligation for the Kingdom's government to promote the development of the international rule of law.

The development of Internet of the international rule of law may be achieved through many mechanisms. Conventions and treaties are one of them, and the ﬁve UN treaties\"), Document(page_content='in outer space are an important example of this. However, also the development of soft law guidelines, TCBMS and the sharing of best practices may be important from the development of the rule of law to this may be added to dissemination of the understanding of International Space law such as through education and the publication of manuals like the Woomera Manual.

Second, the development of soft law does not prevent the ultimate development of hard law. In other areas, such as in international environmental law, soft law norms eventually crystallized into conventions.
