All rights reserved.', '2A significant proportion of the world’s businesses are small and medium-\\nsized enterprises (SMEs). Globally, micro-enterprises (SMEs with fewer \\nthan ten employees) alone account for 70% to 90% of all firms1. As such, \\nSMEs play an important role in reducing global emissions and bringing \\ninnovative climate solutions to the market. It is crucial that they are \\nequipped with the tools and resources needed to measure their emissions, \\nset greenhouse gas reduction targets grounded in science, take bold \\nactions, report on their progress and ultimately reduce their emissions. \\nThis framework provides guidelines for SMEs on doing exactly that. It is \\nopen for anyone to use and can be used directly by SMEs to guide their \\nreporting of climate impacts and strategies to multiple stakeholders. It can \\nalso be used by SME support organizations (such as consultancies) and \\ndata collectors to guide SMEs in climate disclosure.\\nThe IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report is the latest reminder that dangerous climate thresholds are rapidly nearing and that impacts \\nwill continue to occur sooner rather than later. With 1.1°C of warming so far2, our climate has already changed, and some impacts \\nare a reality.  Immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions of greenhouse gas emissions are needed to limit global temperature rise \\nto 1.5°C.\\nThe framework is built up of a core section (consisting of three modules referred to as the “core modules”) and four additional \\nmodules. Each module provides indicators that are considered important for SMEs to report on in their climate disclosures.OVERVIEW  \\nMODULE:\\nENERGY\\nREPORTINGMODULE:\\nVALUE CHAIN  \\nEMISSIONSMODULE:\\nMANAGEMENT & \\nRESILIENCEMODULE:\\nCLIMATE  \\nSOLUTIONS\\nModule Name Reasoning\\nCore Module: Measure Measuring emissions is a crucial first step that every company \\nmust take to understand its negative impact on the climate and \\ntake the right steps to reduce it.\\nCore Module: CommitSetting science-based targets that align with a 1.5°C future \\ndemonstrates a company’s commitment to reduce its \\ncontribution to climate change and provides structure to its \\nclimate action.MEASURE COMMITACTION  \\n& IMPACTCORE MODULES   \\n1Small, Medium, Strong.

', '3We recommend that SMEs adopt the core modules immediately and suggest that they report on the additional modules within \\nthree years. The modular approach is intended to make climate disclosure more manageable for SMEs, allowing them to prioritize \\nthe modules that are most important/relevant for them and their stakeholders. Having worked with SMEs over the last 12 years, \\nCDP has observed that companies can take about three years to build the capacity to provide high-quality data from when they \\nfirst get started. Although we recommend that SMEs report on all the modules in this framework within three years, we strongly \\nencourage them to do it as quickly as possible within that timeframe.Core Module: Action & ImpactReporting on key actions and initiatives a company is taking \\nto reduce its emissions is important for understanding what \\nthe company is doing to meet its targets and the impact of its \\ninitiatives on the company’s emissions.\\nEnergy reportingEnergy-related activities represent, for many sectors, the most \\nsignificant GHG emission sources. It is therefore important that \\ncompanies disclose information about their energy generation \\nand/or consumption. Energy disclosures incentivize companies \\nto pull the right levers for reducing their emissions and impact on \\nclimate change. \\nValue chain emissions A significant proportion of most companies’ emissions lie \\noutside their direct operations and are related to their supply \\nchain and end-users. Companies should measure and report \\nthese emissions and work with their suppliers, customers, and \\nother partners to truly reduce their impact on climate change.\\nManagement and resilienceFor a company to successfully and strategically change in \\nline with the transition to a low carbon economy, it requires \\ncommitment and drive from its leadership. In addition to that, \\nSMEs are often especially vulnerable to risks, including climate-\\nrelated risks, as they often do not have robust risk assessment \\nand management systems in place. Thus, demonstrating \\nclimate leadership and carrying out climate-risk assessments is \\nkey to ensuring competitiveness and climate resilience. \\nClimate solutionsSMEs are a force for innovation globally and have an \\nopportunity for significant contribution in the growing market \\nof low carbon products and services that enable third parties \\nto reduce their emissions throughout their value chains. \\nDisclosure on these products/services and their impacts would \\nenable SMEs to attract investment, allow their business to \\ngrow, and increase their contribution to limiting climate change. ', '4INTRODUCTION\\nThe world is at a critical junction for global climate action. Amid growing \\nattention and ambition, global greenhouse gas emissions still hit an all-\\ntime high in 2019. These need to halve by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050 \\nto decrease the risk of irreversible climate tipping points.\\nBusinesses are demonstrating transformational ambition \\non climate action; corporate leaders have been working to \\nreduce emissions within their operations and improve energy \\nefficiency for years. Corporate commitments are growing, as \\nevident in the exponential growth of companies joining the \\nUN Race to Zero Campaign (more than 3,000 companies) and \\nthe Science-based Targets Initiative (SBTi), with over 1,000 \\ncompanies having set targets aligned to a well-below 2°C or \\n1.5°C trajectory. Yet, much of this ambition and progress has \\nbeen driven by high emitting, large, global corporations due \\nto the public and investor pressure they face to reduce their \\nemissions. As a result, much of the support and guidelines \\navailable for sustainability reporting do not cater to the needs \\nof SMEs. \\nHowever, the transition is already underway, and if SMEs \\nare not brought on board, they risk facing competitive \\ndisadvantages and losing out on low carbon opportunities. \\nIt is vital that SMEs are supported in making the most of \\nthe opportunities presented by transitioning to a low carbon \\neconomy. Their flexibility and capability to innovate makes \\nthem well placed and crucial for providing climate solutions \\nthat are key for limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5°C. \\nSMEs are increasingly being requested to commit to reduce \\ntheir emissions and report progress against their commitments \\nby their stakeholders and lenders. For example, as supply \\nchain emissions are on average 11.4 times higher than \\noperational emissions3, many large companies want their \\nsuppliers, often SMEs, to measure, report and cut down \\ntheir own emissions - cascading climate action down the \\nsupply chain. SMEs that are unable to demonstrate their \\nenvironmental action risk losing out on important opportunities. \\nThis has wider economic and societal impacts as SMEs are \\na backbone of most economies and significantly contribute \\nto employment and social wellbeing. Being major engines of \\nvalue creation, SMEs account for between 50% and 70% of \\nvalue added in OECD economies. In emerging economies, \\nSMEs contribute to, on average, 33% of GDP4. SMEs have a very significant role to play in both employment \\nlevel and employment growth5. In high-income countries, \\nSMEs with up to 250 employees have a 65% contribution \\nto employment; the number rises to 78% for low-income \\ncountries6.  When it comes to employment growth, in a \\nmajority of countries, SMEs between 5-99 employees alone \\naccount for more than 50% of total net employment creation7.  \\nFurthermore, as financial institutions seek to reduce their \\nportfolio emissions, they require environmental data from \\ncompanies to feed into their investment and lending decisions. \\nMany SMEs rely on financing from banks. According to trade \\ncredit insurer Euler Hermes, bank loans make up around 70% \\nof external funding for European SMEs. \\nTherefore, it is important to provide SMEs with the framework, \\ntools and resources needed to set commitments aligned with a \\n1.5°C future and disclose environmental performance. \\nTo address this need, the SME Climate Hub was launched \\nin 2020 in order to support SMEs on a large scale, providing \\nthem with resources to commit to reduce their emissions and \\nreport progress. This Framework will be available on the Hub \\nfor all SMEs to access. \\nDefining SMEs \\nFor the purpose of this framework, SMEs are defined as non-subsidiary organizations with fewer than 500 employees, which \\nis in line with the definition used by the SME Climate Hub and the Science-based Targets Initiative. These can be further \\ncategorized as micro (fewer than 10), small (10-50) and medium (50-500). \\nThe definition of SMEs varies by country/region, however, employee numbers and revenue are the two most used indicators \\nto define SMEs. The varying definitions of SMEs represent the different policy and structural contexts in which they operate \\nas well as their vast heterogeneity8. At a firm and sector level, SMEs have meaningful variations based on other factors \\nsuch as business model and technical and managerial capacities. While these variations demonstrate that size, defined by \\nemployee number, is not the only way to group SMEs, it is still relevant because organizations of similar sizes share significant \\ncommonalities regarding resources and expertise available for environmental action and disclosure. \\n3Transparency to Transformation: A Chain Reaction, CDP Global Supply Chain Report, 2020.\\n4Small, Medium, Strong.

Therefore, they may choose \\nto focus on the core modules (Measure, Commit, Action & Impact). We have decided not to have a separate set of indicators \\nfor these smaller SMEs because as the organization grows, along with its knowledge and reporting capability, it should start \\nreporting on all the modules in this framework. Having the same set of indicators for all SMEs will ensure that the data reported \\nis consistent and comparable, facilitating its use in benchmarking and decision making by investors, purchasers, policymakers \\nand other stakeholders. \\nPurpose\\nThis framework is intended to stimulate SMEs’ understanding and reporting of the most vital climate-related indicators and \\nencourage immediate climate action.\\nIt is recommended that SMEs use this framework to aid their sustainability reporting processes so that data on the SME’s \\nclimate performance can be provided to investors, purchasers, policymakers and other stakeholders in a consistent and \\ncomparable manner. These stakeholders will then be able to reduce their climate risks at a portfolio level and make decisions \\naligned with a net-zero future, while SMEs will be able to meet future requests from these stakeholders and increase their \\ncompetitiveness.\\nUltimately, use of this framework will empower SMEs to measure, manage and track their progress against their climate \\ncommitments and provide a clear pathway to climate leadership. Users of the framework will be enabled to play an active role \\nin the transition to a low carbon world and build resilience to climate change.\\nObjectives\\nIn order to achieve the purpose of stimulating SMEs’ understanding and reporting of the most \\nvital climate-related indicators and encouraging immediate climate action, this framework \\naims to be:\\n  Modular, to enable flexibility to expand into other areas of environmental disclosure;\\n  Understandable, through use of straightforward language\\n  Open access and available for all;\\n  Streamlined and resource efficient to represent the minimum reporting requirements;  \\n  Representative of best practice through alignment with other reporting frameworks.\\nDevelopment\\nBased on experience from CDP’s questionnaire and desktop research, this streamlined reporting framework is co-designed \\nwith the SME Climate Hub represented by the Exponential Roadmap Initiative (XRI), Normative and the We Mean Business \\nCoalition. The development process includes researching the best practice available from other initiatives, standards, and \\nframeworks such as the GHG Protocol, SBTi, TCFD, the 1.5 Business Playbook and the UN Race to Zero criteria. Based on the \\nresearch results, alignment was implemented where deemed appropriate, bearing in mind the specific needs of SMEs and the \\nobjectives of this framework.\\nA public consultation was held, inviting feedback from SMEs, framework stakeholders and other intended users of this \\nframework which informed the refining of the framework. \\nThroughout 2021 and 2022, CDP , in collaboration with the SME Climate Hub, will invite and consolidate feedback from SMEs \\nand other intended users who trial the framework, informing the review and further developments in the framework in an \\niterative process. The framework will be updated on a regular basis in a version-controlled manner. ', '6Intended users\\nThe users of this framework can be divided into three groups: data providers, data users and organizations that link the two. \\nHere, data providers are SMEs that will use the framework to disclose data on their climate impact and action. Data users \\nare defined as organizations that use the disclosed information in decision-making processes involving the data providers. \\nThe two main types of organizations we envisage linking the data providers and users are SME support organizations and \\ndata collectors. Both may connect data providers with the framework, assist with reporting on the indicators defined in the \\nframework, and supply the resulting information to the data users*. Please see examples of these groups in the infographic \\nbelow.\\nDATA PROVIDERS DATA USERS\\n• SMEs \\nFor the definition of SMEs  \\nplease see the section  \\n‘Defining SMEs’ above \\n \\nNote: This also includes SMEs  \\nthat specialize in providing \\nproducts and services that  \\naid companies in reducing  \\ntheir emissions in their  \\nvalue chains.• Procurers or purchasing \\norganizations \\nOrganizations which will use \\ndisclosed data to aid purchasing \\ndecision making\\n• Financial institutions  \\n(investors and lenders) \\nOrganizations which will use \\ndisclosed data to aid investment \\ndecision making. \\n• Other data users such as \\nresearchers and policymakers\\n*We envisage data collectors and SME support organizations linking data providers and data users, but going through these \\nlinking organizations is not necessary.

Additionally, disclosures aligned with \\nthese principles will incentivize climate action among SMEs and improve \\nunderstanding of their environmental impact. \\nThese draw from the principles of the following key frameworks and \\nstandards: TCFD, CDSB and the GHG Protocol. \\n01  Disclosures shall be relevant to SMEs and their data users.\\n02 Disclosures shall be clear and understandable\\n03 Disclosures shall be objective and accurate.\\n04 Disclosures shall be complete and verifiable.\\n05 Disclosures shall be comparable to best practice corporate disclosures. \\n06 Disclosures shall drive impactful SME climate action.\\n07 Disclosures shall be annual and provided in a consistent format. ', '8This section consists of the key areas of disclosure for SMEs. It is recommended that: \\n  SMEs report against metrics and indicators in the core component. \\n  Data users/stakeholders communicate to SMEs which modules they would like to see prioritized depending on the needs  \\n  of the data user and factors unique to the SME, such as business type.\\n  SMEs look to expand their reporting to cover the four additional modules within three yearsMODULES:  \\nREPORTING REQUIREMENTS  \\nAND RECOMMENDATIONS  \\nCORE MODULES  \\nEach module recommends (“should”) or requires (“shall”) certain indicators \\nand metrics from SMEs that are considered to be important, factoring in the \\nrequirements of data users and needs of the SMEs.\\n• Throughout the modules the term \"shall\" is used to indicate a requirement. \\nIndicators denoted using \"shall\" are considered to be crucial reporting for \\nSMEs regardless of the disclosers’ reporting experience.\\n• Throughout the modules the term \"should\" is used to indicate a \\nrecommendation. Indicators denoted using \"should\" are considered to be \\noptional, especially for small SMEs or those in their first year of reporting; \\nhowever, reporting on these indicators is strongly advocated within three years. How to use the Framework \\nThis framework lays out the key climate-related indicators that SMEs should report on, and SMEs should use it to inform their \\ndisclosures. Companies may report this information in their mainstream reports or when using other data collection or reporting \\nplatforms.\\nThis framework does not contain detailed guidance on how to report on the indicators, as there is a lot of guidance available \\nthat is suitable for SMEs to use. The SME Climate Hub has a dedicated “tools and resources” section that we encourage SMEs \\nto utilize when reporting on the indicators in this framework. \\nWe highly recommend reading each module’s “Guidance and definitions” section to understand the indicators laid out \\nin the framework better.MODULE:\\nENERGY\\nREPORTINGMODULE:\\nVALUE CHAIN  \\nEMISSIONSMODULE:\\nMANAGEMENT & \\nRESILIENCEMODULE:\\nCLIMATE  \\nSOLUTIONSMEASURE COMMITACTION  \\n& IMPACT', '9Every company should measure \\nits emissions and determine its \\nimpact on the climate as a starting \\npoint.

You may also find some tools suitable specifically for SMEs in the “Tools and \\nResources” section of the SME Climate Hub.\\nAs specified in the table above, there are two methods of calculating Scope 2 emissions – \\nlocation and market based. \\n• The location-based method considers the average emission factors for the electricity \\ngrids that provide electricity to the reporting organization.\\n• The market-based method reflects emissions from the electricity that the reporting \\norganizations have chosen or purchased in the market. It considers contractual \\narrangements under which the reporting organization procures power from specific \\nsuppliers or sources, such  \\nas renewable energy. \\nAs summarized by the World Resource Institute, reporting both figures tells an important \\nstory about the company’s carbon footprint and carbon reduction strategy. The location-\\nbased method reveals what the company is physically putting into the air, and the market-\\nbased method shows emissions that the company is responsible for through its purchasing \\ndecisions. For more information on this please refer to the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance.\\nReporting year: The most recent 12-month period for which data is provided.\\nGross global emissions: This means total emissions before any deductions or other \\nadjustments are made to take account of things such as offset credits or avoided emissions \\nfrom the use of goods and services.\\nEmissions intensity: Emissions (metric tons CO2e) / Business metric (e.g., revenue). \\nIntensity metrics describe an organization’s CO2e emissions in the context of another \\nbusiness metric. In this way, the emissions are normalized to account for growth. Emissions \\nintensity per unit of revenue is one the most common and easy means to calculate emissions \\nintensity, which is why it is preferred that you provide this figure. However, this is not \\nnecessarily always the most appropriate to individual businesses and therefore you can  \\nalso report an intensity or normalized metric that is most appropriate to your organization’s \\nown operations.', '11It is essential for every company \\nto commit to reduce their \\nenvironmental impact.
