In December 2023, the ISSB amended\\nthe non-climate-related topics and metrics in connection with the International Applicability of SASB Standards\\nproject.\\nEffective Date\\nThis version 2023-12 of the Standard is effective for all entities for annual periods beginning or after January 1, 2025.\\nEarly adoption is permitted for all entities.\\nSUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING STANDARD |COMMERCIAL BANKS |2', 'Table of Contents\\nINTRODUCTION..............................................................................................................................................................4\\nOverview of SASB Standards.....................................................................................................................................4\\nUse of the Standards ................................................................................................................................................. 5\\nIndustry Description ...................................................................................................................................................5\\nSustainability Disclosure Topics & Metrics................................................................................................................. 6\\nData Security ............................................................................................................................................................. 8\\nFinancial Inclusion & Capacity Building ................................................................................................................... 11\\nIncorporation of Environmental, Social, and Governance Factors in Credit Analysis ..............................................14\\nFinanced Emissions .................................................................................................................................................17\\nBusiness Ethics ....................................................................................................................................................... 19\\nSystemic Risk Management .................................................................................................................................... 21\\nSUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING STANDARD |COMMERCIAL BANKS |3', 'INTRODUCTION\\nOverview of SASB Standards\\nThe SASB Standards are a set of 77 industry-specific  sustainability accounting standards ( “SASB Standards ” or\\n“Industry Standards ”), categorised pursuant to the Sustainable Industry Classification  System® (SICS®).\\nSASB Standards include:\\n1. Industry descriptions  – which are intended to help entities identify applicable industry guidance by describing the\\nbusiness models, associated activities and other common features that characterise participation in the industry.\\n2. Disclosure topics  – which describe specific  sustainability-related risks or opportunities associated with the\\nactivities conducted by entities within a particular industry.\\n3. Metrics  – which accompany disclosure topics and are designed to, either individually or as part of a set, provide\\nuseful information regarding an entity ’s performance for a specific  disclosure topic.\\n4. Technical protocols  – which provide guidance on definitions,  scope, implementation and presentation of\\nassociated metrics.\\n5. Activity metrics  – which quantify the scale of specific  activities or operations by an entity and are intended for use\\nin conjunction with the metrics referred to in point 3 to normalise data and facilitate comparison.\\nEntities using the SASB Standards as part of their implementation of ISSB Standards should consider the relevant\\nISSB application guidance.\\nFor entities using the SASB Standards independently from ISSB Standards, the SASB Standards Application\\nGuidance  establishes guidance applicable to the use of all Industry Standards and is considered part of the\\nStandards. Unless otherwise specified  in the technical protocols contained in the Industry Standards, the guidance in\\nthe SASB Standards Application Guidance applies to the definitions,  scope, implementation, compilation and\\npresentation of the metrics in the Industry Standards.\\nHistorically, the SASB Conceptual Framework set out the basic concepts, principles, definitions  and objectives that\\nguided the SASB Standards Board in its approach to setting standards for sustainability accounting.\\nSUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING STANDARD |COMMERCIAL BANKS |4', 'Use of the Standards\\nSASB Standards are intended to aid entities in disclosing information about sustainability-related risks and\\nopportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity ’s cash flows,  its access to finance  or cost of capital\\nover the short, medium or long term. An entity determines which Industry Standard(s) and which disclosure topics are\\nrelevant to its business, and which associated metrics to report. In general, an entity should use the SASB Standard\\nspecific  to its primary industry as identified  in SICS® . However, companies with substantial business in multiple SICS®\\nindustries should refer to and consider the applicability of the disclosure topics and associated metrics in additional\\nSASB Standards.\\nThe disclosure topics and associated metrics contained in this Standard have been identified  as those that are likely\\nto be useful to investors. However, the responsibility for making materiality judgements and determinations rests with\\nthe reporting entity.\\nIndustry Description\\nCommercial banks accept deposits and make loans to individuals and corporations, and engage in lending to\\ninfrastructure, real estate and other projects. By providing these services, the industry serves an essential role in the\\nfunctioning of global economies and in facilitating the transfer of financial  resources to their most productive capacity.\\nThe industry is driven by the volume of deposits, quality of loans made, the economic environment and interest rates.\\nThe risk from mismatched assets and liabilities further characterises the industry. The regulatory environment\\ngoverning the commercial banking industry witnessed significant  changes in the wake of the 2008 global financial\\ncrisis and continues to evolve today. These and other regulatory trends may affect performance. Commercial banks\\nwith global operations must manage new regulations in many jurisdictions that are creating regulatory uncertainty,\\nparticularly regarding the consistent application of new rules.\\nNote: This standard addresses ‘pure play ’ commercial banking services, which may not include all the activities of\\nintegrated financial  institutions, such as investment banking and brokerage services, mortgage finance,  consumer\\nfinance,  asset management and custody services, and insurance. Separate standards address the sustainability\\nissues for activities in those industries.\\nSUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING STANDARD |COMMERCIAL BANKS |5', 'SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE TOPICS & METRICS\\nTable 1.

Because of the interconnectedness of the global financial  system, these failures can contribute to\\nsignificant  market disruption and financial  crises. The systemic interconnectedness of financial  institutions has\\nbecome a central concern for regulators. As a result, many jurisdictions require that banks undergo supervised stress\\ntests to evaluate whether the entity has sufficient  capital reserves and liquidity to absorb losses, continue operations\\nand meet obligations during adverse economic and financial  conditions. Failure to meet regulatory requirements may\\nlead to penalties and substantially increased future compliance costs. Commercial banks should improve their\\ndisclosures by measuring how well they can absorb shocks arising from systemic stresses to demonstrate how risks\\nassociated with their size, complexity, interconnectedness, substitutability and cross-jurisdictional activity are being\\nmanaged.

       " 'ABOUT THE SASB STANDARDS As of August 2022, the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) of the IFRS Foundation assumed responsibility for the SASB Standards. The ISSB has committed to maintain, enhance and evolve the SASB Standards and encourages preparers and investors to continue to use the SASB Standards. IFRS S1 General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information (IFRS S1) requires entities to refer to and consider the applicability of disclosure topics in the SASB Standards when identifying sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect an entity ’s prospects. Similarly, IFRS S1 requires entities to refer to and consider the applicability of metrics in the SASB Standards when determining what information to disclose regarding sustainability-related risks and opportunities. In June 2023, the ISSB amended climate-related topics and metrics in the SASB Standards to align them with the industry-based guidance accompanying IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures . In December 2023, the ISSB amended the non-climate-related topics and metrics in connection with the International Applicability of SASB Standards project. Effective Date This version 2023-12 of the Standard is effective for all entities for annual periods beginning or after January 1, 2025. Early adoption is permitted for all entities.

       " 'INTRODUCTION Overview of SASB Standards The SASB Standards are a set of 77 industry-specific sustainability accounting standards ( “SASB Standards ” or “Industry Standards ”), categorised pursuant to the Sustainable Industry Classification System® (SICS®). SASB Standards include: 1. Industry descriptions – which are intended to help entities identify applicable industry guidance by describing the business models, associated activities and other common features that characterise participation in the industry. 2. Disclosure topics – which describe specific sustainability-related risks or opportunities associated with the activities conducted by entities within a particular industry. 3. Metrics – which accompany disclosure topics and are designed to, either individually or as part of a set, provide useful information regarding an entity ’s performance for a specific disclosure topic. 4. Technical protocols – which provide guidance on definitions, scope, implementation and presentation of associated metrics. 5. Activity metrics – which quantify the scale of specific activities or operations by an entity and are intended for use in conjunction with the metrics referred to in point 3 to normalise data and facilitate comparison. Entities using the SASB Standards as part of their implementation of ISSB Standards should consider the relevant ISSB application guidance. For entities using the SASB Standards independently from ISSB Standards, the SASB Standards Application Guidance establishes guidance applicable to the use of all Industry Standards and is considered part of the Standards. Unless otherwise specified in the technical protocols contained in the Industry Standards, the guidance in the SASB Standards Application Guidance applies to the definitions, scope, implementation, compilation and presentation of the metrics in the Industry Standards. Historically, the SASB Conceptual Framework set out the basic concepts, principles, definitions and objectives that guided the SASB Standards Board in its approach to setting standards for sustainability accounting. SUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING STANDARD |COMMERCIAL BANKS |4',\n",
       " 'Use of the Standards SASB Standards are intended to aid entities in disclosing information about sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity ’s cash flows, its access to finance or cost of capital over the short, medium or long term. An entity determines which Industry Standard(s) and which disclosure topics are relevant to its business, and which associated metrics to report. In general, an entity should use the SASB Standard specific to its primary industry as identified in SICS® . However, companies with substantial business in multiple SICS® industries should refer to and consider the applicability of the disclosure topics and associated metrics in additional SASB Standards. The disclosure topics and associated metrics contained in this Standard have been identified as those that are likely to be useful to investors. However, the responsibility for making materiality judgements and determinations rests with the reporting entity. Industry Description Commercial banks accept deposits and make loans to individuals and corporations, and engage in lending to infrastructure, real estate and other projects. By providing these services, the industry serves an essential role in the functioning of global economies and in facilitating the transfer of financial resources to their most productive capacity. The industry is driven by the volume of deposits, quality of loans made, the economic environment and interest rates. The risk from mismatched assets and liabilities further characterises the industry. The regulatory environment governing the commercial banking industry witnessed significant changes in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis and continues to evolve today. These and other regulatory trends may affect performance. Commercial banks with global operations must manage new regulations in many jurisdictions that are creating regulatory uncertainty, particularly regarding the consistent application of new rules. Note: This standard addresses ‘pure play ’ commercial banking services, which may not include all the activities of integrated financial institutions, such as investment banking and brokerage services, mortgage finance, consumer finance, asset management and custody services, and insurance. Separate standards address the sustainability issues for activities in those industries. SUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING STANDARD |COMMERCIAL BANKS |5',\n",

Entities that fail to safeguard customer data may be susceptible to decreased revenue and consumer confidence. As the growth in mobile banking and cloud storage continues and more bank operations become technology- and internet-dependent, data security management becomes increasingly important. Sophisticated technology and continuous staff training are essential amid growing cybersecurity threats. The metrics for this disclosure topic focus on providing more detail on efforts related to safeguarding data against emerging and continuously evolving cybersecurity threats and technologies, and security breaches compromising customers ’ information. Enhanced disclosure on management strategies to address these risks may permit shareholders to understand how commercial banks are protecting shareholder value. Metrics FN-CB-230a.1.

       " 'Financial Inclusion & Capacity Building Topic Summary As their primary business activity, commercial banks must continuously balance their capacity building efforts with the risks and opportunities associated with lending to unbanked, underbanked or underserved customers. Emerging financing models and technologies provide banks with an opportunity to offer products and services in previously underserved markets and obtain additional sources of revenue. Entities that can meet the need to extend credit and financial services to low-income populations and small businesses while avoiding predatory and irresponsible lending practices may create long-term value and improve brand reputation. These services also should be complemented by efforts to improve financial literacy, which will assist customers in making informed decisions. By disclosing their approach to financial inclusion and capacity building, commercial banks can provide investors with decision-useful information for assessing banks ’ ability to ensure long-term, sustainable value creation.

       " 'Incorporation of Environmental, Social, and Governance Factors in Credit Analysis Topic Summary As financial intermediaries, commercial banks contribute to significant positive and negative environmental and social externalities through their lending practices. Environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors can have material implications for the underlying entities, assets and projects to which commercial banks lend across a range of industries. Therefore, entities increasingly must examine ESG factors when determining the quality of collateral. Commercial banks also may enable positive environmental and social externalities to generate significant revenue streams through their lending practices. Commercial banks that fail to address these risks and opportunities could face diminished returns and reduced value for shareholders. Commercial banks should subsequently disclose how ESG factors are integrated into lending processes and the current level of portfolio risk associated with specific sustainability trends. Specifically, investor and regulatory pressure is mounting for banks to disclose how they address climate change related risks. Metrics FN-CB-410a.2.

       " 'Financed Emissions Topic Summary Entities participating in commercial banking activities face risks and opportunities related to the greenhouse gas emissions associated with those activities. Counterparties, borrowers or investees with higher emissions might be more susceptible to risks associated with technological changes, shifts in supply and demand and policy change which in turn can impact the prospects of a financial institution that is providing financial services to these entities. These risks and opportunities can arise in the form of credit risk, market risk, reputational risk and other financial and operational risks. For example, credit risk might arise in relation to financing clients affected by increasingly stringent carbon taxes, fuel efficiency regulations or other policies; credit risk might also arise through related technological shifts. Reputational risk might arise from financing fossil-fuel projects. Entities participating in commercial banking activities are increasingly monitoring and managing such risks by measuring their financed emissions. This measurement serves as an indicator of an entity ’s exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities and how it might need to adapt its financial activities over time. Metrics FN-CB-410b.1.

Entities must adhere to a complex and often inconsistent set of rules relating to performance and conduct, as well as provide disclosure on issues including insider trading, antitrust behaviour, price fixing and market manipulation. Entities are subject to strict legal requirements against tax evasion, fraud, money laundering and corrupt practices. In some jurisdictions, enhanced rewards for whistle-blowers may increase the number of complaints brought to regulators. Entities that ensure regulatory compliance through robust internal controls may build trust with clients, increase revenue and protect shareholder value by minimising losses incurred because of legal proceedings.

       " 'Systemic Risk Management Topic Summary Commercial Bank entities that fail to manage risks to capital effectively may suffer significant losses while increasing their liabilities. Because of the interconnectedness of the global financial system, these failures can contribute to significant market disruption and financial crises. The systemic interconnectedness of financial institutions has become a central concern for regulators. As a result, many jurisdictions require that banks undergo supervised stress tests to evaluate whether the entity has sufficient capital reserves and liquidity to absorb losses, continue operations and meet obligations during adverse economic and financial conditions. Failure to meet regulatory requirements may lead to penalties and substantially increased future compliance costs. Commercial banks should improve their disclosures by measuring how well they can absorb shocks arising from systemic stresses to demonstrate how risks associated with their size, complexity, interconnectedness, substitutability and cross-jurisdictional activity are being managed. Entities that commit to enhanced disclosures may experience improved investor and shareholder confidence, potentially leading to increased revenues. Metrics FN-CB-550a.1. Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB) score, by category 1The entity shall disclose its Globally Systematically Important Bank (G-SIB) score for these categories: (1) size, (2) cross-jurisdictional activity, (3) interconnectedness, (4) substitutability, (5) complexity and (6) overall score. 2The G-SIB scores are defined by, and shall be calculated according to, the methodology established by the latest version of the Bank of International Settlements ’ (BIS) Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ’s Global systematically important banks: updated assessment methodology and the higher loss absorbency requirement (BCBS assessment methodology). 2.1 The set of indicators used in the calculation of the G-SIB score is outlined by the BCBS assessment methodology in the reporting instructions and the reporting template. 2.1.1 The entity shall refer to the reporting instructions and the reporting template for the relevant reporting period. 2.2 The G-SIB score calculation is provided by the technical summary of the BCBS assessment methodology. The BCBS assessment methodology further provides: 2.2.1 denominators used for score calculation for the relevant reporting period; and 2.2.2 the cut-off score used to identify G-SIBs, and bucket thresholds used to allocate G-SIBs to buckets for the purposes of calculating the specific higher loss absorbency (HLA) requirements for each institution. 3 The entity shall disclose the latest available G-SIB score at the time of reporting.

       "['ABOUT THE SASB STANDARDS As of August 2022, the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) of the IFRS Foundation assumed responsibility for the SASB Standards. The ISSB has committed to maintain, enhance and evolve the SASB Standards and encourages preparers and investors to continue to use the SASB Standards. IFRS S1 General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information (IFRS S1) requires entities to refer to and consider the applicability of disclosure topics in the SASB Standards when identifying sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect an entity ’s prospects. Similarly, IFRS S1 requires entities to refer to and consider the applicability of metrics in the SASB Standards when determining what information to disclose regarding sustainability-related risks and opportunities. In June 2023, the ISSB amended climate-related topics and metrics in the SASB Standards to align them with the industry-based guidance accompanying IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures . In December 2023, the ISSB amended the non-climate-related topics and metrics in connection with the International Applicability of SASB Standards project. Effective Date This version 2023-12 of the Standard is effective for all entities for annual periods beginning or after January 1, 2025. Early adoption is permitted for all entities. SUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING STANDARD |COMMERCIAL BANKS |2',\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION Overview of SASB Standards The SASB Standards are a set of 77 industry-specific sustainability accounting standards ( “SASB Standards ” or “Industry Standards ”), categorised pursuant to the Sustainable Industry Classification System® (SICS®). SASB Standards include: 1. Industry descriptions – which are intended to help entities identify applicable industry guidance by describing the business models, associated activities and other common features that characterise participation in the industry. 2. Disclosure topics – which describe specific sustainability-related risks or opportunities associated with the activities conducted by entities within a particular industry. 3. Metrics – which accompany disclosure topics and are designed to, either individually or as part of a set, provide useful information regarding an entity ’s performance for a specific disclosure topic. 4. Technical protocols – which provide guidance on definitions, scope, implementation and presentation of associated metrics. 5. Activity metrics – which quantify the scale of specific activities or operations by an entity and are intended for use in conjunction with the metrics referred to in point 3 to normalise data and facilitate comparison. Entities using the SASB Standards as part of their implementation of ISSB Standards should consider the relevant ISSB application guidance. For entities using the SASB Standards independently from ISSB Standards, the SASB Standards Application Guidance establishes guidance applicable to the use of all Industry Standards and is considered part of the Standards. Unless otherwise specified in the technical protocols contained in the Industry Standards, the guidance in the SASB Standards Application Guidance applies to the definitions, scope, implementation, compilation and presentation of the metrics in the Industry Standards. Historically, the SASB Conceptual Framework set out the basic concepts, principles, definitions and objectives that guided the SASB Standards Board in its approach to setting standards for sustainability accounting. SUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING STANDARD |COMMERCIAL BANKS |4',\n",
       " 'Use of the Standards SASB Standards are intended to aid entities in disclosing information about sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity ’s cash flows, its access to finance or cost of capital over the short, medium or long term. An entity determines which Industry Standard(s) and which disclosure topics are relevant to its business, and which associated metrics to report. In general, an entity should use the SASB Standard specific to its primary industry as identified in SICS® . However, companies with substantial business in multiple SICS® industries should refer to and consider the applicability of the disclosure topics and associated metrics in additional SASB Standards. The disclosure topics and associated metrics contained in this Standard have been identified as those that are likely to be useful to investors. However, the responsibility for making materiality judgements and determinations rests with the reporting entity. Industry Description Commercial banks accept deposits and make loans to individuals and corporations, and engage in lending to infrastructure, real estate and other projects. By providing these services, the industry serves an essential role in the functioning of global economies and in facilitating the transfer of financial resources to their most productive capacity. The industry is driven by the volume of deposits, quality of loans made, the economic environment and interest rates. The risk from mismatched assets and liabilities further characterises the industry. The regulatory environment governing the commercial banking industry witnessed significant changes in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis and continues to evolve today. These and other regulatory trends may affect performance. Commercial banks with global operations must manage new regulations in many jurisdictions that are creating regulatory uncertainty, particularly regarding the consistent application of new rules. Note: This standard addresses ‘pure play ’ commercial banking services, which may not include all the activities of integrated financial institutions, such as investment banking and brokerage services, mortgage finance, consumer finance, asset management and custody services, and insurance. Separate standards address the sustainability issues for activities in those industries. SUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING STANDARD |COMMERCIAL BANKS |5',\n",

Entities that fail to safeguard customer data may be susceptible to decreased revenue and consumer confidence. As the growth in mobile banking and cloud storage continues and more bank operations become technology- and internet-dependent, data security management becomes increasingly important. Sophisticated technology and continuous staff training are essential amid growing cybersecurity threats. The metrics for this disclosure topic focus on providing more detail on efforts related to safeguarding data against emerging and continuously evolving cybersecurity threats and technologies, and security breaches compromising customers ’ information. Enhanced disclosure on management strategies to address these risks may permit shareholders to understand how commercial banks are protecting shareholder value. Metrics FN-CB-230a.1.

       " 'Incorporation of Environmental, Social, and Governance Factors in Credit Analysis Topic Summary As financial intermediaries, commercial banks contribute to significant positive and negative environmental and social externalities through their lending practices. Environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors can have material implications for the underlying entities, assets and projects to which commercial banks lend across a range of industries. Therefore, entities increasingly must examine ESG factors when determining the quality of collateral. Commercial banks also may enable positive environmental and social externalities to generate significant revenue streams through their lending practices. Commercial banks that fail to address these risks and opportunities could face diminished returns and reduced value for shareholders. Commercial banks should subsequently disclose how ESG factors are integrated into lending processes and the current level of portfolio risk associated with specific sustainability trends. Specifically, investor and regulatory pressure is mounting for banks to disclose how they address climate change related risks. Metrics FN-CB-410a.2.

Counterparties, borrowers or investees with higher emissions might be more susceptible to risks associated with technological changes, shifts in supply and demand and policy change which in turn can impact the prospects of a financial institution that is providing financial services to these entities. These risks and opportunities can arise in the form of credit risk, market risk, reputational risk and other financial and operational risks. For example, credit risk might arise in relation to financing clients affected by increasingly stringent carbon taxes, fuel efficiency regulations or other policies; credit risk might also arise through related technological shifts. Reputational risk might arise from financing fossil-fuel projects.

       " 'Systemic Risk Management Topic Summary Commercial Bank entities that fail to manage risks to capital effectively may suffer significant losses while increasing their liabilities. Because of the interconnectedness of the global financial system, these failures can contribute to significant market disruption and financial crises. The systemic interconnectedness of financial institutions has become a central concern for regulators. As a result, many jurisdictions require that banks undergo supervised stress tests to evaluate whether the entity has sufficient capital reserves and liquidity to absorb losses, continue operations and meet obligations during adverse economic and financial conditions. Failure to meet regulatory requirements may lead to penalties and substantially increased future compliance costs. Commercial banks should improve their disclosures by measuring how well they can absorb shocks arising from systemic stresses to demonstrate how risks associated with their size, complexity, interconnectedness, substitutability and cross-jurisdictional activity are being managed. Entities that commit to enhanced disclosures may experience improved investor and shareholder confidence, potentially leading to increased revenues. Metrics FN-CB-550a.1.
