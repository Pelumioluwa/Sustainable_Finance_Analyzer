      "[' \\n1 \\n \\n \\nEuropean  SRI Transparency  Code  \\nThe European  SRI Transparency  Code  (the Code)  focuses  on SRI funds  distributed  publicly  in Europe  \\nand is designed  to cover  a range  of assets  classes,  such  as equity  and fixed  income.  \\nAll information  pertaining  to the European  SRI Transparency  Code  can be found  at the following  \\nwebsite:  www.eurosif.org . The Code comes  with  a Guidance  Manual  for fund  managers  on how  to \\nbest  use and respond  to the Code.  The present  version  of the Code  was approved  by the Board  of \\nEurosif  in Febru ary 2018 . \\nREVISION OF THE CODE  \\nIn 2017 the Code was updated to better reflect the continuing evolution of the European SRI market. \\nA Working Group was set up to facilitate revision of the Code in line with the latest developments in \\nthe industry and in view of the latest work carried ou t by experts at the European and global level.  \\nApplications to sign up  to the Code will now be in line with key elements of the recommendations \\nmad e by the Task Force on Climate -related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), Article 173 of the French TECV \\nAct and the latest recommendations made by the High -Level Group of Experts on Sus tainable Finance \\n(HLEG) in its  final report published in January 2018. Questions that are specifically designed to reflect \\nthose recommendations/legislation are indicated in the Code with footnotes.  \\n \\nTWO  KEY MOTIVATIONS  UNDERPIN  THIS  CODE  \\n1. The opportunity  for retail  SRI funds  to provide clarification  to investors  and other  \\nstakeholders  about their SRI approach in an easily  accessible  and comparable  format.  \\n2. Proactive  strengthen ing of  self-regulation  to contribute  to the development  and promotion  \\nof SRI funds  by setting  up a common  framework  for transparency  best  practices.  \\nGUIDING  PRINCIPLE  \\nSignatories  to the Code  should  be open  and honest  and should disclose  accurate,  adequate  and timely  \\ninformation  to enable  stakeholders,  especially  consumers,  to understand  the ESG policies  and \\npractices  of the fund.  \\n \\nCOMMITMENTS  BY SIGNATORIES  \\n• The order  and exact  wording  of the questions  should  be followed ; \\n• Responses  should  be informative  and clear,  and the resources  and methodologies  used  should  \\nbe described  in as much  detail  and as precis ely as possible;  \\n• Funds  should  report  data  in the currency  that they  use for other  reporting  purposes;  \\n• Reasons  preventing  the fund  from  providing  all or part of the information  to a given  question  \\nshould  be clearly  stated  and,  in such  case s, signatories  should  state  when  they  will be able  \\nto answer  the question;  ', ' \\n2 \\n \\n• Responses  should  be updated  at least  on an annual  basis  and should  have  a precise  publication  \\ndate;  \\n• Responses  to the Code  should  be easily  accessible  from  the website of the fund  and/or  of the \\nfund  manage r. In any case,  signatories  should  make  it clear  where  to find the information  \\nrequired  by the Code;  \\n• Signatories  are solely  responsible  for the answers  to the questions,  and should  state  this in \\ntheir  response . \\n Statement  of Commitment  \\n \\nComplete/modify  the below  section  accordingly  \\n \\nSustainable  and Responsible  Investing  is an essential  part of the strategic  positioning  and behaviour  \\nof COMPANYXXX.  We have  been  involved  in SRI since  YEARXXX  and welcome  the European  SRI \\nTransparency  Code.  \\nThis is our first/second /XXXth statement  of commitment  and covers  the period  XXX to XXX.  Our full \\nresponse  to the European  SRI Transparency  Code  can be accessed  below  and is available  in the annual  \\nreport  of the retail  funds  and on our website.  \\n \\nCompliance  with  the Transparency  Code   \\n \\nFUNDMANAGERXXX  is committed  to transparency  and we believe  that we are as transparent  as \\npossible  given  the regulatory  and competitive  environments  that exist  in the countries  in which  we \\noperate.  COMPANYXX  meets  the full recommendations  of the European  SRI Transparency  Code  with  \\nthe exception  of QUESTIONXX  & YY. (If the full recommendations  are not met,  please  state  if and \\nwhen  you hope  to comply  with  the questions  you cannot  answer  at this time).  \\n \\nDATEXXX  \\n \\n \\nEurosif  classification  of Sustainable  and Responsible  Investment1 strategies   \\n \\nSustainability  Themed  Investment : investment  in themes  or assets  linked  to the development  of \\nsustainability.  Thematic  funds  focus  on specific  or multiple  issues  related  to ESG.  Sustainability  \\nThemed  Investments  inherently  contribute  to addressing  social  and/or  environmental  challenges , \\nsuch  as climate  change,  eco-efficiency  and health.  Funds  are required  to perform  an ESG analysis  or \\nscreen ing of investments  in order  to come under this category . \\nBest -in-Class  Investment  Selection : approach  according to which  leading  or best -performing  \\ninvestments  within  a universe,  category  or class  are selected  or weighted  based  on ESG criteria.  This \\napproach  involves  the selection  or weighting  of the best -performing  or most  improved  companies  or \\n                                                           \\n1 Sustainable and responsible investment (”SRI”) is a long -term oriented investment approach which \\nintegrates ESG factors in the research, analysis and selection process of securities within an investment \\nportfolio. It combines fundamental analysis and enga gement with an evaluation of ESG factors in order to \\nbetter capture long -term returns for investors and to benefit society by influencing the behaviour of \\ncompanies. Ref. Eurosif 2016  ', ' \\n3 \\n \\nassets  as identified  by ESG analysi s within  a defined  investment  universe.  This approach  includes  best-\\nin-class,  best -in-universe  and best -effort.  \\nNorms -Based  Screening : screening  of investments  according  to their  compliance  with  international  \\nstandards  and norms.  This approach  involves  the screening  of investments  based  on international  \\nnorms  or combinations  of norms  covering  ESG factors.  International  norms  on ESG are those  defined  \\nby international  bodies , such  as the United  Nations  (UN).   \\nExclusion  of Holdings  from  Investment  Universe : an approach  that excludes  specific  investments  or \\nclasses  of investment  from  the investible  universe , such  as companies,  sectors  or countries.  This \\napproach  systematically  excludes  companies,  sectors  or countries  from  the permissible  investment  \\nuniverse  if they are involved  in certain  activities  based  on specific  criteria.  Common  criteria  include  \\nweapons,  pornography,  tobacco  and animal  testing.  Exclusions  can be imposed  at the individual  fund  \\nor mandate  level,  but also increasingly  at the asset  manager  or asset  owner  level,  across  the entire  \\nproduct  range  of assets.  This approach  is also referred  to as ethical  or value s-based  exclusion,  as \\nexclusion  criteria  are typically  based  on the choices  made  by asset  managers  or asset  owners.   \\nIntegration  of ESG Factors  into Financial  Analysis : the explicit  inclusion  by asset  managers  of ESG risks  \\nand opportunities  in traditional  financial  analysis  and investment  decisions  based  on a systematic  \\nprocess  and appropriate  research  sources.  This category  covers  explicit  consideration  of ESG factors  \\nalongside  financial  factors  in the mainstream  anal ysis of investments.  The integration  process  focuses  \\non the potential  impact  of ESG issues  on company  financials  (positive  and negative),  which  in turn  may  \\naffect  the investment  decision.  \\nEngagement  and Voting  on Sustainability  Matters : engagement  activities  and active  ownership  \\nthrough  voting  of shares  and engagement  with  companies  on ESG matters.  This is a long -term  process  \\nthat seek s to influence  behaviour  or increase  disclosure.  Engagement  and voting  on corporate  \\ngovernance  are necessary,  but are not sufficient  in themselves for inclusion in this category . \\nImpact  Investing : impact  Investments  are investments  in companies,  organisations  and funds  with  the \\nintention  of generat ing a  social  and environmental  impact  alongside  a financial  return.  Impact  \\ninvestments  can be made  in both  emerging  and developed  markets  and target  a range  of returns  from  \\nbelow  market -to-market  rate,  depending  upon  the circumstances2. Investments  are often  project -\\nspecific  and distinct  from  philanthropy,  as the investor  retains  ownership  of the asset  and expects  a \\npositive  financial  return.  Impact  invest ing includes  microfinance,  community  investing,  social  \\nbusiness/entrepreneurship  funds  and French  fonds  solidaires . \\nContent s \\n1.

The Code comes with a Guidance Manual for fund managers on how to best use and respond to the Code. The present version of the Code was approved by the Board of Eurosif in Febru ary 2018 . REVISION OF THE CODE In 2017 the Code was updated to better reflect the continuing evolution of the European SRI market. A Working Group was set up to facilitate revision of the Code in line with the latest developments in the industry and in view of the latest work carried ou t by experts at the European and global level. Applications to sign up to the Code will now be in line with key elements of the recommendations mad e by the Task Force on Climate -related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), Article 173 of the French TECV Act and the latest recommendations made by the High -Level Group of Experts on Sus tainable Finance (HLEG) in its final report published in January 2018. Questions that are specifically designed to reflect those recommendations/legislation are indicated in the Code with footnotes. TWO KEY MOTIVATIONS UNDERPIN THIS CODE 1. The opportunity for retail SRI funds to provide clarification to investors and other stakeholders about their SRI approach in an easily accessible and comparable format. 2. Proactive strengthen ing of self-regulation to contribute to the development and promotion of SRI funds by setting up a common framework for transparency best practices. GUIDING PRINCIPLE Signatories to the Code should be open and honest and should disclose accurate, adequate and timely information to enable stakeholders, especially consumers, to understand the ESG policies and practices of the fund. COMMITMENTS BY SIGNATORIES • The order and exact wording of the questions should be followed ; • Responses should be informative and clear, and the resources and methodologies used should be described in as much detail and as precis ely as possible; • Funds should report data in the currency that they use for other reporting purposes; • Reasons preventing the fund from providing all or part of the information to a given question should be clearly stated and, in such case s, signatories should state when they will be able to answer the question;',\n",
       " '2 • Responses should be updated at least on an annual basis and should have a precise publication date; • Responses to the Code should be easily accessible from the website of the fund and/or of the fund manage r. In any case, signatories should make it clear where to find the information required by the Code; • Signatories are solely responsible for the answers to the questions, and should state this in their response . Statement of Commitment Complete/modify the below section accordingly Sustainable and Responsible Investing is an essential part of the strategic positioning and behaviour of COMPANYXXX. We have been involved in SRI since YEARXXX and welcome the European SRI Transparency Code. This is our first/second /XXXth statement of commitment and covers the period XXX to XXX. Our full response to the European SRI Transparency Code can be accessed below and is available in the annual report of the retail funds and on our website. Compliance with the Transparency Code FUNDMANAGERXXX is committed to transparency and we believe that we are as transparent as possible given the regulatory and competitive environments that exist in the countries in which we operate. COMPANYXX meets the full recommendations of the European SRI Transparency Code with the exception of QUESTIONXX & YY. (If the full recommendations are not met, please state if and when you hope to comply with the questions you cannot answer at this time). DATEXXX Eurosif classification of Sustainable and Responsible Investment1 strategies Sustainability Themed Investment : investment in themes or assets linked to the development of sustainability. Thematic funds focus on specific or multiple issues related to ESG. Sustainability Themed Investments inherently contribute to addressing social and/or environmental challenges , such as climate change, eco-efficiency and health. Funds are required to perform an ESG analysis or screen ing of investments in order to come under this category . Best -in-Class Investment Selection : approach according to which leading or best -performing investments within a universe, category or class are selected or weighted based on ESG criteria. This approach involves the selection or weighting of the best -performing or most improved companies or 1 Sustainable and responsible investment (”SRI”) is a long -term oriented investment approach which integrates ESG factors in the research, analysis and selection process of securities within an investment portfolio. It combines fundamental analysis and enga gement with an evaluation of ESG factors in order to better capture long -term returns for investors and to benefit society by influencing the behaviour of companies. Ref. Eurosif 2016',\n",
       " '3 assets as identified by ESG analysi s within a defined investment universe. This approach includes best- in-class, best -in-universe and best -effort. Norms -Based Screening : screening of investments according to their compliance with international standards and norms. This approach involves the screening of investments based on international norms or combinations of norms covering ESG factors. International norms on ESG are those defined by international bodies , such as the United Nations (UN). Exclusion of Holdings from Investment Universe : an approach that excludes specific investments or classes of investment from the investible universe , such as companies, sectors or countries. This approach systematically excludes companies, sectors or countries from the permissible investment universe if they are involved in certain activities based on specific criteria. Common criteria include weapons, pornography, tobacco and animal testing. Exclusions can be imposed at the individual fund or mandate level, but also increasingly at the asset manager or asset owner level, across the entire product range of assets. This approach is also referred to as ethical or value s-based exclusion, as exclusion criteria are typically based on the choices made by asset managers or asset owners. Integration of ESG Factors into Financial Analysis : the explicit inclusion by asset managers of ESG risks and opportunities in traditional financial analysis and investment decisions based on a systematic process and appropriate research sources. This category covers explicit consideration of ESG factors alongside financial factors in the mainstream anal ysis of investments. The integration process focuses on the potential impact of ESG issues on company financials (positive and negative), which in turn may affect the investment decision. Engagement and Voting on Sustainability Matters : engagement activities and active ownership through voting of shares and engagement with companies on ESG matters. This is a long -term process that seek s to influence behaviour or increase disclosure. Engagement and voting on corporate governance are necessary, but are not sufficient in themselves for inclusion in this category . Impact Investing : impact Investments are investments in companies, organisations and funds with the intention of generat ing a social and environmental impact alongside a financial return. Impact investments can be made in both emerging and developed markets and target a range of returns from below market -to-market rate, depending upon the circumstances2. Investments are often project - specific and distinct from philanthropy, as the investor retains ownership of the asset and expects a positive financial return. Impact invest ing includes microfinance, community investing, social business/entrepreneurship funds and French fonds solidaires . Content s 1. List of funds covered by the Code 2.

       "[\"Do not harm We check whether the manager of the \\x00nancial product does not use your money to invest in companies or governments that are involved in activities and practices that are generally considered as very harmful. ESG due diligence using the ‘double materiality' perspective Each investment is screened for its potential positive or negative impact on sustainability issues like nature, labour conditions and good governance (ESG). Additionally, the possible impact of sustainability events like climate change, social unrest or legal controversies on the performance of the investments, is analysed. We exclude certain sectors No money for weapons, tobacco, coal, unconventional oil & gas and laggard oil & gas and electricity utilities. International norms and standards Investee companies must not violate high-level normative frameworks like the UN Global Compact, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and the ILO Conventions. Positive impact Going beyond the minimal requirement of ‘do no harm’, the product manager shall use your money to invest in projects, companies or governments with a positive contribution to society. This is done by following at least one of these additional strategies.HOME›THE LABEL›QUALITY STANDARD 1 2THE LABEL The Quality Standard for sustainable investing The Quality Standard stipulates a set of portfolio and process level requirements. A \\x00nancial product should at least ful\\x00l these requirements to receive the label. They are a mix of exclusion, impact, engagement, transparency and accountability.
